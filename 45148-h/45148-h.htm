<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p>Most of the contents of the following pages
were given as lectures in Manchester College,
Oxford, in the autumn of 1911. I have
thought it better to confine myself within the
limits of what I then said, rather than to expand
and recast the lectures into a complete
monograph on the Pharisees. My aim throughout
has been to present and make clear the
Pharisaic conception of religion, the point of
view from which they regarded it, and the
methods by which they dealt with it. It is
far more important that the reader, especially
the Christian reader, should understand the
meaning of Pharisaism than that he should
be presented with a survey of all the details,
theological, ethical, historical, and other, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>cluded
in the wide field of the Pharisaic
literature. I am not without hope that a
small book may be read where a large one
would be passed by, and that the ends of
justice&mdash;in this case justice to the Pharisees&mdash;may
thereby be the better attained. I have
not sought to write a panegyric on them, but,
so far as may be possible for one who is not
a Jew, to present their case from their own
standpoint, and not, as is so often done, as a
mere foil to the Christian religion. This is one
reason why I have not referred to the writings
of other scholars, except in the one case of
Weber. He is typical of them all in their
attitude towards Rabbinical Judaism. Even
the fine work of Oesterley and Box, <i>The
Religion and Worship of the Synagogue</i>,
though it is written in a spirit of courtesy, and
with a sincere desire to understand the Rabbinical
position and to recognise whatever is
good in it, yet judges it by the standard of the
Christian religion. Something was still left
to be done, by way of treating Pharisaism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
fairly, that is, without either contempt or condescension;
and that "something" I have
tried to do&mdash;whether successfully or not, the
candid reader will judge.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I tender my thanks to the
Hibbert Trustees, to whom I owe the opportunity
of delivering the lectures, and to the
authorities of Manchester College, Oxford, for
the invitation to do so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smcap">Historical Sketch</span></h2>


<p>The subject to which in the following pages
I shall invite the reader's attention is one
which may seem to promise but little of living
interest, and still less of religious worth. The
Pharisees are presented in the New Testament
in no favourable light; and the average
Christian has not much further acquaintance
with them. Yet, though the name be now
disused, the principles of Pharisaism have been
maintained down to the present day; and it
is these, more than anything else, which have
kept Judaism as a living religion. That
Pharisaism should wear an unpleasing aspect
in the New Testament is not surprising; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
it was not in the nature of things that the
adherents of the old religion should understand
or be understood by those of the new, in the
times when they parted company. And there
has not been much attempt at mutual understanding
in all the centuries since. Christianity
could by no possibility have remained in union
with Pharisaism; what Jesus began, and what
Paul completed, was a severance as inevitable
as it was painful. But it was painful because
it was the dividing, not of the living from the
dead, but of the living from the living. The
Judaism of the Pharisees, from which Christianity
tore itself away, was no obsolete formalism,
but a religion having the power to satisfy the
spiritual wants of those who were faithful
to it. The form in which its religious ideas
were expressed is peculiar, and to Christians
by no means attractive. While, therefore, the
Christian has usually but little inclination to
inquire into the real significance of Pharisaism,
and but scanty means of informing himself
even if he were so inclined, the fact remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that such knowledge is necessary if he would
rightly understand the attitude of the New
Testament to the older religion.</p>

<p>Pharisaism is usually judged from the outside,
as seen by not very friendly eyes; and,
even of those Christians who have studied the
Pharisaic literature and who thus know it to
some extent from the inside, there are few
who seem able to imagine what it must have
been to those whose real religion it was. No
one but a Jew, of whom it may be said that
the Talmud runs in his blood, can fully realise
the spiritual meaning of Pharisaism; but
sympathy can show even to a Christian much
of that meaning, and it is on the strength of
that sympathy that I rest my hope of carrying
out my present task. Briefly, I wish to show
what Pharisaism meant to the Pharisees
themselves, as a religion having a claim to be
judged on its own merits, and not by comparison
with any other. The knowledge thus
obtained will throw light upon many passages
in the New Testament; but it will be chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
valuable if it helps the reader to realise that
the Pharisees were "men of like passions with
us," men with souls to be saved, who cared a
great deal for the things of the higher life,
men who "feared God and worked righteousness,"
and who pondered deeply upon spiritual
problems, though they did not solve them
on Christian lines, nor state the answers in
Christian terms.</p>

<p>It ought not to be impossible to do this in
compass of a small book; and I hope that,
when I have done, I shall have left with the
reader some clear idea of who the Pharisees
were and what they stood for, and a more just
appreciation of them than is indicated by the
word "hypocrites." I can at least say how
they appear to me, as the result of exploring
their literature, which has been to me the
fascinating study of thirty years.</p>

<p>In this first chapter I shall survey the
history of the development of Pharisaism,
from its source in Ezra to its final literary
embodiment in the Talmud. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
chapter will deal with the theory of Torah,
and Pharisaism as the system intended to put
that theory into practice. Then I shall
consider Pharisaism in reference, firstly, to
Jesus, and, secondly, to Paul. Some general
points of Pharisaic theology will be dealt with
in the fifth chapter; and in the concluding
one I shall try to present Pharisaism as a
spiritual religion.</p>

<p>I proceed now to the historical survey of
the development of Pharisaism.</p>

<p>A great Rabbi, Resh Lakish, who lived in
the third century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, uttered the saying that,
"when the Torah was forgotten, Ezra came
up from Babylon and re-established it; when
it was forgotten again, Hillel came up from
Babylon and re-established it; and when it
was forgotten again, R. &#7716;ija and his sons
came up from Babylon and re-established it"
(b. Succ. 20ª). The meaning of that remark
is that <i>Pharisaism</i> traced its origin back to
Ezra; for it was the Pharisaic tradition which
counted Hillel, and R. &#7716;ija, and the Talmudic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Rabbis generally amongst its exponents.
And while no one would say that Ezra was a
Pharisee, it is true that he was the spiritual
ancestor of the Pharisees more than of any
other element in post-exilic Judaism. In the
time of Christ, Judaism was represented by
Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Apocalyptists,
Hellenists; and all could claim a share in the
inheritance of Israel. But the Sadducees had
little reason to set up a descent from Ezra;
and what was peculiar to Apocalyptists and
Hellenists (two terms which of course overlap)
was entirely unconnected with him.
Pharisaism alone was the result of his work;
and Pharisaism alone survived, to carry down
through the centuries the spiritual treasure
of Israel. Moreover, of all the elements in
Judaism, Pharisaism is the one which was
least affected by foreign influences. What it
borrowed, from Greece or Rome, from Persia
or Egypt, it fused into its own mould, or
merely treated as unimportant curiosities; it
never wavered for a moment in its allegiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to its own ground principle, never swerved
from the line of development of which Ezra
had marked the beginning, and for which he
might be said to have stated the formula.
The Talmud shows the traces of contact
with Greek language and Roman law, gives
glimpses of men of many nations, from Babylonians
to Goths and even Germans (j. Jom.
45<sup>b</sup>). But, from one end to the other, it is
the embodiment of a principle which Ezra
was the first to introduce; and like a huge
tree it has all grown from the seed which he
planted. If Ezra could have looked forward
and seen what the Talmud became, the vision
would have filled him with delight; also, with
deep thankfulness to God that he had been
the means of giving to Israel what Israel
needed.</p>

<p>I will reserve for the next chapter the explanation
of the theory of Torah, which is the
key to the whole system of Pharisaism in
general, and to the work of Ezra in particular.
But without some reference to that theory I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
cannot show what it was that Ezra did, and
that the Pharisees carried on. If some of
the statements I make appear to be unfounded
or improbable, I ask the reader to suspend his
judgment on them till I come to the theory
which, as I believe, justifies them.</p>

<p>Ezra was the first who seriously took in
hand the problem of the future of Israel after
the great convulsion of the Exile. For nearly
a century after the time, 536 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when liberty
to return had been given, the small band of
Jews in and around Jerusalem had maintained
with difficulty their place as a nation and
the religion of their fathers. Subjects of the
Persian king, like their neighbours, they were
exposed to dangers, both political and religious,
against which they were ill able to guard.
They had the Temple as the central point of
their religion; but the Temple was no protection
against the influence of contact with
"the peoples round about," nor did the performance
of its ritual give any lead in the
direction of a new religious development. Till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Ezra came, the Jews did hardly more than
mark time, if indeed they were not gradually
losing ground. If Ezra had not come, it is
conceivable, and indeed highly probable, that
Judaism would have disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>The significance of the work of Ezra is this,
that he stopped the process by which the
religious vitality of Israel was draining away,
and he gave a lead, opened a new line of
development, turned the thought and energy
of his people into a direction where progress
was possible almost without end.</p>

<p>His reformation was carried out with a
severity which would have been impossible
unless he had had the support of Nehemiah,
armed as governor with the authority of the
Persian king. And the success he achieved
was only won in the face of bitter opposition,
and at a cost of domestic suffering and heart-burning
which still makes one shudder as one
reads of it in the book which bears his name.
It was a case in which "diseases desperate
grown, by desperate appliance are relieved."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Ezra had it clear in his mind that if Israel
was to survive at all, it must resolutely cut
itself off from all possible contact with what
was not Israel. It must become a closed corporation,
a community occupying not merely
a political but much more a religious and
social enclosure of its own, within which it
could work out its own salvation. In the
catastrophe of the Exile, Ezra read the lesson
that indiscriminate association with neighbouring
peoples had corrupted its religious life,
and brought upon a faithless nation a deserved
punishment. If now Israel let itself relapse
into the old way of intercourse and alliance
with non-Israelites, the result would be the
final extinction of Israel.</p>

<p>Such a prospect might have been tolerable
if there had been nothing left for Israel to do.
Some of those who opposed Ezra may well
have thought that there was nothing which
could demand so hard a sacrifice as that which
he would force upon them. Why should they
not live in peace with their neighbours, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
do as they did? And why could they not
keep their old religion, without making it a
source of enmity abroad, and a cause of grief
at home?</p>

<p>But Ezra had a clear perception of what
there was for Israel to do. That religion,
which in former times had been mainly the
collective expression of the nation's relation
to God, must now be realised as the personal
concern of each individual. What the prophets
had taught about God had so far produced no
corresponding result in personal piety and conscious
service. What had been declared by
Moses as the will of God had been by no means
fully taken to heart and wrought into the acts
of daily life. There was divine teaching in
abundance, and had been for centuries; now,
the task must be seriously taken in hand of
applying it, so that each individual might feel
that he had a responsibility for doing the will
of God, and might know what that will was.
The great declaration: "Hear, O Israel, the
Lord thy God the Lord is one," was immedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>ately
followed by: "and thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might." If Israel
now asked how he was to do this, Ezra's answer
was that God had taught him in the Torah,
contained in the five books of Moses. Henceforth
let Israel "observe to do all that is written
in this book of the Torah." That solemn
promulgation of the Torah, described in the
book of Nehemiah, is the central point of the
reformation of Ezra, whether it were only
the Priestly Code which was then introduced
or whether it were the Pentateuch substantially
complete. What Ezra did was to set up a
written authority as the guide of personal
conduct for each individual Jew. His demand
was for the acceptance of this authority on the
part of the nation, and a determined loyalty in
carrying out the commands of God which
would shrink from no sacrifice. It was, no
doubt, the severity of this demand which for
thirteen years delayed its acceptance; and the
opposition was only crushed by the strong hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of Nehemiah. Whatever one may think of
the method, the result was that Ezra gathered
to him those who were prepared to do most
and to sacrifice most for the sake of their
religion; he had weeded out the weak and
the faint-hearted, the indifferent and the lazy,
and kept those who could be fanatics, heroes,
martyrs, if the occasion should arise.</p>

<p>The Jewish community having accepted the
policy of Ezra, was in this position:&mdash;it was
separated by its own act from all avoidable
contact with those whom we may now call
Gentiles; and, within the enclosure thus as it
were railed off, it was free to work out its
national life on the lines of the religion of
Torah, free also to interpret that religion of
Torah in such ways as it might see fit. Ezra
had secured for it a field of action and given to
it the task it should perform there. If I say
that Ezra was the second founder of the religion
of Israel, I do not mean to imply that everything
in the later Judaism owed its origin to
him, still less that what survived from the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>-exilic
Judaism was only what he endorsed and
gave out again. The older religion had come
down from a far-distant past; the ancient
writings, prophetic, historical, legal, were
witnesses of God's former dealings with His
people; they still had the memory, as they
renewed after the Exile the practice, of the
ancient customs and religious rites. And the
later Judaism could, and did, develop in several
directions, taking up, as it were, suggestions
from the older religion, and not confining itself
to the line which Ezra more especially marked
out. But the work of Ezra is practically the
only channel by which whatever survived from
the ancient religion passed into the later, and
became the Judaism which is properly so called.</p>

<p>In some of its representatives later Judaism
departed widely from the principles of Ezra,
and Christianity may be said to be in part
a protest against and a revolt from those
principles; but nevertheless, if it had not been
for Ezra there would have been no Judaism
sufficiently alive to protest, or sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
vigorous to produce revolt. Ezra saved the
life of the Jewish people, none the less that in
later times there were Jews who cherished
ideals which were far different from his.</p>

<p>I am concerned here only with one particular
line of development of the later Judaism, the
one which in an especial degree was originated
by Ezra. This is the line of the religion of
Torah strictly so called, meaning by that the
religion which found expression in the intention
of fulfilling, as a personal duty, the commands
of God set forth in the Scriptures, and especially
in the Pentateuch. This is not a full or
an exact statement of the meaning of the
religion of Torah; but it will serve for the
present purpose, and I shall go into detail
about it in the next chapter. Judaism, as the
religion of Torah, required that every Jew
should be in a position to know what was contained
in the Torah and what it meant. There
must be someone whose business it was to
study the Torah and explain its contents, and
to show how the precepts it contained were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
be applied to cases not directly provided for.
Teaching of that kind, to the extent at all
events of giving instruction in moral and
religious duties, had been given from time
immemorial, and mainly by the priests. And
there were still priests who could, and probably
did, perform the same function. But the case
was now different when every Jew was expected
to know the commandments of the Torah, and
was directly concerned with their bearing upon
his own actions. This new necessity of the
time was met by the labours of a new class
of men, viz. the Scribes (Sopherim). It is
significant that Ezra himself is called "the
priest the <i>Scribe</i>." It is also significant that
the men who assisted him by "explaining the
sense," when he first read publicly the book
of the Torah, were not priests but Levites.
It is natural to suppose that many Levites
chose to take up the important, honourable,
and sacred work of the Scribe, the interpreter
of the divine teaching, rather than to perform
the menial duties of serving the priests in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Temple. Whether Ezra definitely organised
and founded the order of the Scribes, I do not
know; but the appearance of them is a necessary
result of his policy, and may well be
attributed to him. The term Sopherim is
vouched for, as extremely ancient, in certain
phrases mentioned in the Talmud.</p>

<p>The duties of the Sopherim would be, in
the first instance, to study the Torah themselves,
then to teach it to others, then to act
as interpreters and judges in cases where
appeal was made to them to know how, under
such and such circumstances, the divine command
was to be fulfilled. Now it is scarcely
conceivable that each individual Scribe would
feel himself at liberty to expound the Torah
entirely according to his own judgment, without
reference to what other Scribes might
teach; or that such unfettered liberty would
have been allowed to him if he had tried to
use it. There must have been some amount
of consultation of the Scribes with each other;
and there must have been some kind of tribunal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to which appeal could be made, some central
authority whose decision would be recognised
as final. Otherwise, the whole attempt made
by Ezra would have ended in failure almost at
the outset; and it did not end in failure. Now
the Talmud contains some scanty references
to an assembly called "The Men of the Great
Synagogue," to which were attributed certain
ancient institutions and sayings. That the
statements in the Talmud about the Great
Synagogue are all historically trustworthy is
by no means the case. But the Rabbis who
are responsible for those statements may well
have been right in the main fact, though not
in the details. The Great Synagogue, as they
represented it, is clearly based upon the
description of the assembly in Neh. x. And
there is nothing to show that that assembly,
or anything like it, became a permanent institution.
But an assembly of some kind, a
council of men "learned in the law," is the
most natural form which would be taken by
such a central authority as the system insti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>tuted
by Ezra required for its successful
working. It must remain an open question
whether such a council was permanent, its
members being chosen for life, or whether it
was such an assembly as might be called
together, <i>ad hoc</i>, from time to time, whether
the number of its members was fixed, and on
what conditions and by whom they were
appointed. Upon these points the Rabbis of
the Talmud had no certain tradition, perhaps
no tradition at all. That the conception of
the Great Synagogue was modelled upon the
pattern of the Assembly in Neh. x. only means
that the Rabbis had no better guide for their
imagination in reconstructing what nevertheless
must have been. And the same reason which
prompted the calling of that historical council,
under Nehemiah, would suggest that the
natural tribunal from time to time would be
a similar council of elders and learned men.
This is all that is required to give a historical
basis to the traditions concerning the Great
Synagogue. Less than this leaves the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
unexplained; more than this opens the way
for the discrepancies which have been used
for discrediting those traditions altogether. I
believe we are therefore warranted in retaining
the name of the Great Synagogue, to mean
in the first instance Ezra and those who supported
him, and then those who in later times
exercised authority on his lines and in his spirit.</p>

<p>Now it is nowhere stated in the Rabbinical
literature, so far as I know, that the Sopherim
of the early times were identical with the Men
of the Great Synagogue. But they are closely
associated, they seem to stand on the same
level of antiquity, and, what is still more
important, no distinction is drawn between
their several functions, except that the Men
of the Great Synagogue ordained (<i>tikk&#277;nu</i>)
certain things, while the Sopherim only taught
and expounded. As just stated, there is no
agreement amongst scholars upon the question
whether the Great Synagogue was a real body
or not; but of the existence of the Sopherim
there is no room for doubt. And the Sopherim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
are the key (if I am right) to the meaning of the
term, "Men of the Great Synagogue." That
term represents the Sopherim acting together
as a council to decide religious questions; a
council not necessarily permanent, but called
together from time to time as occasion might
require. But it would be a council of Sopherim,
<i>not</i> of all the leading men of the nation. The
authority in public matters was, under the
Persian governor, in the hands of the priestly
aristocracy, whose interests lay in other directions
besides that of the study of Torah.
What was done by the Sopherim, and those
with and for whom they worked, was done
privately and without official sanction. The
Rabbinical tradition which mentions the
Z&#363;g&#333;th, or pairs, and calls one the Nasi and
the other the Ab-beth-din, and implies that the
one was president and the other vice-president
of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, is certainly incorrect. The
Nasi was never the president of the Sanhedrin,
in times when the Sanhedrin was still the great
council of the State. But it may very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
have been the case that in the meetings of the
Sopherim, in other words, the Great Synagogue,
there were a president and a vice-president;
and that the names recorded in pairs in the
Talmud are the names of some of the later
of these officers. I should add that this explanation
of the meaning of the term, "Men
of the Great Synagogue," and the identification
with them of the early Sopherim, is only
a theory of my own; but it is the result of
long consideration of the problem.</p>

<p>In an often-quoted passage from the treatise
of the Mishnah called the Pirké Ab&#333;th, three
sayings are ascribed to the Men of the Great
Synagogue: "Be deliberate in judgment;
make many disciples; make a hedge for the
Torah." It will be of use at this point to
consider these sayings, because they throw
light upon the development of the religion of
Torah in the particular direction indicated by
the name Pharisaism.</p>

<p>To prove that these dicta were actually
uttered by the Men of the Great Synagogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is impossible. But it is admitted that they
are very ancient; and the tradition which
places them at the forefront of the development
of Rabbinism has this much in its favour,
that they logically belong there. Either they
date from a time not remote from Ezra, or
they express the opinion of some later teacher
as to the aims and methods of those who in
that early time were responsible for the
training of the people in the religion of
Torah. This latter interpretation is possible;
but the form in which the brief statement is
made clearly shows that the Rabbis who compiled
the Mishnah had no suspicion that the
dicta in question were the utterances of a later
teacher. If they had had such a thought they
would have expressed it thus: "Rabbi so-and-so
said that the Men of the Great Synagogue
had said, etc." There is no hint that
the three maxims are anything else but an old
tradition; and the fact that these and no more
are ascribed to the Men of the Great Synagogue
indicates, by its very moderation, some reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
for so ascribing them. A capricious inventor
would have attributed much more to so
ancient an authority, in order to obtain for
his inventions the sanction of high antiquity.
There is really nothing improbable in the
transmission, even from the time of Ezra, of
these bare fragments of ancient teaching.
Their contents are in keeping with this supposition;
and, if they were a later invention,
they nevertheless accurately describe what
the men of Ezra's time must chiefly have had
at heart. They are instructions to do certain
things, and are addressed to persons who had
some special responsibility in reference to the
Torah. We have seen that the central idea
of Ezra's reformation was to make the Torah
the inspiring and controlling influence in
Jewish life, both national and individual.
To this end it was needful that the people
should be taught, that they might know what
was in the Torah, <i>i.e.</i> what God had given for
their instruction; also that they should be
able to appeal to competent authority for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
settlement of doubtful points. The Torah
was the source of divine truth and divine
justice, and both must be made accessible to
those whose life as a conscious service of God
depended on them. The shrine in which the
divine treasure was contained must be kept
safe from injury, as if it were protected by
a fence.</p>

<p>The three maxims, ascribed to the Men of
the Great Synagogue, were intended, as it
would seem, for the guidance of teachers and
expounders of Torah. They were the lines
which the Sopherim collectively agreed upon,
for their own practice as interpreters and
judges. Deliberation in judgment is the key
to the casuistry of the Talmud, and in the
main justifies that casuistry. For what does
it amount to except the desire to study a
question from every possible point of view,
and to take into account every possible, even
though improbable, contingency?</p>

<p>To make disciples, in the sense of imparting
knowledge of Torah, has always been the aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and the practice of Rabbinical Judaism; a
fact to which the Talmud bears ample witness.
The names, Torah, Talmud, Mishnah, Midrash,
all imply the idea of teaching and learning&mdash;study
as regarded either by the student or the
instructor. In this larger relation, the minor
one of discipleship to a particular teacher
holds but a small place. Equally the ancient
Scribe or the later Rabbi was enjoined not
to make adherents of himself, but to impart
to all whom he could influence the knowledge
of divine truth which he possessed.</p>

<p>To "make a hedge about the Torah" is a
famous phrase that has been much misunderstood.
It certainly does not imply any
intention to make a rigid system of precept
in which all the spiritual freedom enjoyed
by the enlightened soul in communion with
God should be lost. The Talmudic Rabbis,
who entirely endorsed the maxim, never read
in it any such intention, and never supposed
that they suffered any such loss of spiritual
freedom. As in fact they did not. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
notion that they did is an idea which only
exists in the minds of Christians, misreading
an experience which, as Christians, they have
never known. What was always understood
by the "hedge about the Torah" was the
means taken to keep the divine revelation
from harm, so that the sacred enclosure, so
to speak, might always be free and open for
the human to contemplate and commune with
the divine. And, so far as the Torah consisted
of precepts, positive and negative, the
"hedge" was of the nature of warnings
whereby a man might be saved from transgression
before it was too late. The detailed
mass of precept elaborated in the course of centuries,
known as the Halachah (see Chapter II.)
or rule of right conduct, and finally embodied
in the Talmud, was part of the Torah itself
made explicit, the divine teaching so far as it
related to such and such departments of
conduct. And even if the Halachah were
the rigid and oppressive system which it is
often supposed to have been, but which those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
who devised it and lived under it did not feel
it to be, it was not itself the "hedge about the
Torah." The religious guides of the Jewish
people, from the early Sopherim to the latest
Rabbi whose words are incorporated in the
Talmud, did make a "hedge about the Torah";
and did their work so well that, whatever else
was torn from Israel in the course of cruel
centuries, the Torah remained, and still
remains, the peculiar treasure of the chosen
people.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at this length upon the consideration
of the work of Ezra, and of those
teachers closely associated with him known as
the Sopherim or Men of the Great Synagogue,
because, when once that is clearly understood,
all the subsequent developments are easy to
follow. I have not yet mentioned Pharisaism,
except here and there in passing. But, given
such a principle as is contained in Ezra's conception
of the religion of Torah, Pharisaism
was certain to appear sooner or later, and the
Talmud itself was the implied, though distant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
result of the process by which that conception
was to be worked out.</p>

<p>Devotion to Torah, and the duty of regulating
life, whether individual or national,
according to its precepts, were of the essence
of the Judaism which took its character from
Ezra. This was the principle; and those who
adhered to it sought to apply it over the
whole range of action, public as well as private.
The Sopherim would have their opinion as
to the way, for instance, in which the Temple
ritual should be performed; but it is likely
enough that the priests would keep the control
of such matters in their own hands, so that
the Sopherim would have their main influence
as the teachers of the people in the ordinary
walks of life. Through the Synagogue, of
which I shall have more to say in the next
chapter, the Sopherim came into close touch
with the individual Jew in his private capacity,
and acquired there an influence which was
never afterwards shaken. In this way, the
religion of Torah, on the lines of Ezra, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
made the religion of the majority of the
nation. And, while it was held with varying
degrees of understanding and attachment, we
may note that there were two institutions
or usages which mark the points where the
religion of Torah took deepest and strongest
hold upon the national mind. These were
the rite of circumcision and the observance of
the Sabbath. I do not mean that circumcision
had not been practised, nor the Sabbath
observed, in times previous to Ezra, but that
these became especially prominent after his
time as the <i>sine qua non</i> of Judaism, essentials
to be maintained at any cost. The institution
of the Synagogue provided a means of developing
the spiritual life of the people in a
way that the Temple ritual hardly could and
certainly did not do. And although, as long
as the Temple stood, that was regarded as
the most sacred shrine and most glorious embodiment,
or rather culmination, of the national
religion, yet the religion of Torah learned to
do without the Temple, but it never dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of doing without the Synagogue. With the
Synagogue were associated the devotional outpourings
of the Psalmists, and the earliest
liturgy, also the regular reading of the Scriptures.
These, together with exhortation or
instruction, gave substance and meaning to
the idea of public worship, which, in a form
hitherto unknown in the ancient world, was
in itself one of the most important of Jewish
institutions. The study of Torah produced
in course of time new practices which became
traditional, or gave a new sanction to old ones;
while the principles of exposition by which
these results were produced&mdash;in other words,
the teachings of the Sopherim&mdash;were accepted
and recognised as legitimate by those for
whose guidance they were given.</p>

<p>So far as the religion of Torah is concerned,
the process of its development may be conceived
to have gone on with no interruption,
upon such general lines, during the centuries
between Ezra and the Maccabees. When that
period was reached, 167 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and onwards, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
main lines of Judaism were clearly defined,
and the chief things known which were incumbent
upon the Jew if he would be true
to his religious profession. He knew not
only what he should do, by way of service to
God, but why he should do it. The ideal
before him was the thought of that service,
not as an irksome task imposed on him, but
as a willing and glad devotion of himself and
all his powers to God. That every individual
Jew could or did rise to the height of that
ideal, no one would maintain. In the nature
of things the spiritual energy, which was
mighty in Ezra, could not continue with unimpaired
force through the centuries after he
was gone. In fact, there is no one to compare
with him in this respect until R. Akiba, at
the end of the first Christian century. But
it is far from true to say that the spiritual
meaning of the religion of Torah, as above
described, was lost sight of, or even greatly
obscured, in the generations which succeeded
Ezra. If that had been the case, there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
have been no Maccabean revolt. For the
tenacity of adhesion and the fierceness of
resistance cannot be explained merely by blind
loyalty to a tradition whose inner meaning
was no longer understood and its spiritual
power no longer felt. There must have been
a real allegiance to the religion of Torah, in
principle though not extending to minor
details, on the part of the majority of the
nation, a conscious acceptance of the essentials,
though often without the zeal or perhaps the
power to follow out those main principles to
their conclusion. There would naturally be
considerable difference in the degree of attachment
to the religion of Torah, on the part of
different individuals or sections of the nation,
varying from enthusiastic devotion to a careless,
almost nominal allegiance, that could easily
transfer itself to some other religion whose
demands were less severe and whose worldly
advantages were greater than those of Judaism.</p>

<p>For a considerable time after Ezra, the nation
was, in regard to its religion, homogeneous in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
this sense, that there was not, unless in individuals
here and there, any question of another
religion than Judaism. While the Jews were
under Persian rule, the Persian religion may
have influenced the Jewish religion in some
respects; but there was never any question
of a secession from Judaism to the religion of
Persia. Within the range of Judaism the
worship of the God of Israel was the only
worship; and while some might be zealous and
others lukewarm, some might be more concerned
with the pomp and circumstance of the
Temple, and others with the more homely piety
of the Synagogue, yet all alike owned the
religion of Torah as their religion, and felt
themselves united as brethren in spite of
fraternal discords.</p>

<p>But when, after the fall of the Persian
Empire (332 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), the influence of Greek ideas
and practices began to be felt, a serious danger
arose which threatened the very existence of
Judaism. Whether it was the Syrian or the
Egyptian king who for the time held possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of Judea, the result was the same in giving
a strong impetus to the adoption of Greek
civilisation. Greeks settled in the chief towns
in large numbers, either as officials of the
government or for trade. Greek art and
learning had their representatives. Greek
builders erected temples and theaters to be the
visible symbols of a foreign religion, and of
practices alien to Jewish ideas of morality.
The Greek met the Jew at every turn; and
the Jew would not have been human if he had
been wholly unaffected by that close association.
The brilliance of Greek culture made it
attractive both on its good and on its bad side,
its exquisite sense of beauty and its shameless
gaiety of vice. Its natural fascination was
increased by the fact that it was actively promoted
by the influence of the court. The road
to royal favour and civil advancement lay
through the adoption of Greek manners and
customs, and even dress. A Greek sovereign
might think it prudent to tolerate the peculiarities
of his Jewish subjects; but he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sympathy with them, and could not understand
them. He would welcome every indication of
a desire to replace Jewish ideas and practices
by Greek ones, and would use his influence
accordingly.</p>

<p>During the hundred and sixty years from
the fall of the Persian Empire to the revolt of
the Maccabees, the virus of Hellenism was
infecting the Jewish nation; perhaps for good,
certainly for evil. Probably no class of society
was wholly immune from it. Its effects were
most conspicuous in the ranks of the wealthy
and powerful, the nobles and the priestly aristocracy
who came into closest relations with the
court and depended most upon the royal favour.
But Hellenism had its attractions for all, high
or humble; its outward signs could be seen all
over the land, inviting a comparison between
the gaiety and freedom of Greek life and the
moral restraints and sober seriousness of the
Jewish.</p>

<p>What gradually resulted was, <i>not</i> a division
between the upper classes and the lower, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
all the former went over to Hellenism while all
the latter remained faithful to Judaism, but
a decline towards Hellenism, on the part of a
minority in which all classes were represented.
Probably the number of those who went
entirely over to Hellenism was only small,
compared with the whole Jewish population.
But there were many whose hold upon Judaism
was more or less weakened; and there were
only a few who remained unflinching in their
loyalty to the ancestral faith. That this was
really the case, is shown by the fact that a
special name was applied to those who thus
rigidly adhered to the principles and maintained
to the fullest extent the practices of Judaism
as the religion of Torah. If they had been the
majority of the nation they would not have
needed or received any special name. These
faithful few were the &#7716;asidim, the Assideans
of the Books of Maccabees. Thus Hellenists
and &#7716;asidim represented the Extreme Left
and the Extreme Right of the Jewish nation,
with moderates of various shades in between.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The name &#7716;asid, which is a common word in
Hebrew, indicates a type rather than a party.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The use of the word in the Psalms, where most
of the instances of its occurrence in the Old
Testament are found, does not warrant us,
other reasons apart, in assuming that there is
a special reference in those passages to the
men who became conspicuous under Judas
Maccabæus.</p>

<p>The rebellion against Antiochus Epiphanes
was, of course, in the main a religious revolt,
and, as such, it had the support of all in the
nation except the avowed Hellenists. But
there was this difference in the motive of the
insurgents, that Mattathias and his sons, who
started the rebellion, were fighting for political
freedom as well as for their religion. The
&#7716;asidim only fought for their religion. It was
dire necessity which turned them from passive
resisters into active fighters. They joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Mattathias and his companions because only
by fighting could the Torah now be defended,
for whose sake hitherto they had been willing
to suffer and die. Mattathias rebelled because
the royal power was being used to undermine
the national religion, and he wished to throw
off the royal power. He would not have been
content with permission to practise his religion
undisturbed. He was as staunch, though not
as strict, an adherent of the religion of Torah
as any of the &#7716;asidim; but he would have the
Jews free to serve God, independent of any
permission from a foreign ruler.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of the war the political
and the religious motives were too closely
blended to be distinguished. But it is to be
noted that the &#7716;asidim were the first to
desire peace (1 Macc. vii. 13). And later on,
when the Maccabean princes reaped the fruits
of the war in successful sovereignty, they were
regarded with increasing ill-will by those to
whom the religion of Torah was of supreme
importance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot, of course, attempt to follow in
detail the history of the Jewish people under
the Maccabean princes. But the significance
of the rebellion for my present purpose can
be very soon explained.</p>

<p>The result upon the Jewish people generally
was to renew its hold upon the religion of
Torah. Hellenism for a time was greatly
weakened. There was now at the head of
the Jewish state a Jewish prince, able to hold
his own against foreign powers. The religion
of Torah was, nominally at least, the religion
of all Jews, from the palace to the cottage;
and it should be observed that the special
name of the &#7716;asidim dropped out of use.</p>

<p>But gradually a divergence appeared, not
wholly unlike that which had led to the
rebellion. The princes of the Maccabean
house naturally looked for their supporters
in the great families to whom belonged the
chief positions of rank and wealth, especially
those connected with the Temple. The
religion of Torah was mixed up with politics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to a degree which displeased those who did
not belong to the governing class. There
was, therefore, again a movement towards
a stricter interpretation of the Torah and a
more thorough-going obedience to its requirements,
on the part of a minority on the one
side, to correspond with the movement towards
what might be called "worldliness"
on the part of a minority on the other side.
These two extremes had names by which they
were distinguished. Those who formed the
governing class, the great families and the
chief priests, were the Sadducees. Those who
maintained the full strictness of the religion
of Torah were the Pharisees. They were
virtually the &#7716;asidim over again, under another
name. They were in a minority, when compared
with the whole nation; but the sympathy
of the people in general was with them as
against the Sadducees.</p>

<p>The particular reason why they were called
Pharisees (<i>Pher&#363;shim</i>, separated), was that
they formed themselves into separate societies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pledged to observe certain rules in the matter
of meat, drink, clothing, etc., according as these
were clean or unclean, allowed or forbidden.
They thereby "separated" themselves from
such as were less strict, or who at least did
not take their pledge as a guarantee of strictness.
But it is clear that there was practically
nothing new in what the Pharisees did or in
the religion they held, except the mere fact
of association in pledged companies. The
religion which they thus set themselves to
realise in its full extent was essentially the
religion of Torah as Ezra had moulded it.
Successive generations of Sopherim had worked
out into fuller detail the implicit contents of
the Torah, as changing circumstances called
for further interpretation of the original
precepts. But there was no breach of continuity
between Ezra and the Pharisees, either
in principle or even in the means by which
that principle was worked out. For there
were in every generation the teachers and
expounders of the Torah, as there were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
those who depended on the guidance of such
teachers. The name of the Men of the Great
Synagogue had passed out of use, as it was
believed that the institution itself came to an
end. But the Rabbinical tradition recorded
the names of those who successively handed
on the teaching in which the meaning of the
Torah was unfolded, and its application to
new conditions indicated. The line of this
descent is through the Pharisees and not
through the Sadducees. Not because the
Sadducees did not care about the religion of
Torah; but because the Pharisees, strange as
it may sound, kept the religion of Torah as a
living principle, capable of being adapted and
needing to be adapted to fresh developments
of religious life, while the Sadducees held to
the letter of the original scripture, and refused
innovations. The practical bearing of this
appears in the fact that the Sadducees kept
in their own hands, as long as they could,
not merely the governing authority, but the
judicial power in criminal cases. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hostility between Pharisees and Sadducees
was expressed in a long struggle for the
mastery. The Pharisees never obtained permanently
the political mastery. But they did
gain, for some of their representatives, a place
in the Sanhedrin, the great assembly of the
leading men of the nation. And, what was
more, they did obtain a control over the
Temple, to this extent that the ritual there
was performed according to the requirements
of the Pharisees, the Sadducean priests consenting
to this as the condition on which they
held their office. It is stated in the Mishnah
(Joma iii. 5) that representatives of the
Beth-Din, <i>i.e.</i> Pharisees, administered an oath
to the High Priest on the day of atonement,
saying to him: "'Sir, High Priest, we are the
delegates of the Beth-Din, and thou art our
delegate and the delegate of the Beth-Din, and
we adjure thee, by Him whose name dwells
on this house, that thou wilt not alter a thing
of all that we have said to thee,' and he departs,
weeping, and they depart, weeping." A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
singular touch, expressive, as it would seem,
of mutual distrust.</p>

<p>The Pharisees also succeeded at last in
wresting from the Sadducees the power of
judicial decision in criminal cases; and the
ancient calendar, known as Megillath Taanith,
marks the 14th Tammuz (July) as a festival,
because on that day the Sadducean penal code
was abolished. This same calendar, which is
a Pharisaic document, contains several other
anti-Sadducean references.</p>

<p>The Pharisees, then, represent that element
in the Jewish nation which was most zealous
for the religion of Torah, and most thorough-going
in the application of its principles. So
long as the Sadducees existed, the name
Pharisee also remained.</p>

<p>With the downfall of the Jewish state, after
the war of <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70, the Sadducees disappear
from history. The Pharisees remained, as
representing all that was left alive of Judaism;
but the name was no longer needed, and seldom
if ever used. The Jewish remnant were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
indeed all Pharisees, in the strict sense of the
term; but they were on the whole in sympathy
with them, as they always had been.</p>

<p>If I have clearly indicated the relations of
the Pharisees and Sadducees to each other,
and to the mass of the nation, it will be easy
to indicate the place of two other classes of
persons bearing well-known names. The
Essenes stand apart from the main body of the
Jewish people; they were ascetics and recluses,
of more than Pharisaic strictness (for asceticism
was not a characteristic feature of Pharisaism
either in practice or theory), and they combined
with the religion of Torah certain
mystical doctrines of their own. Whatever
influence they may have had upon other
elements in Judaism, they had little if any
upon Pharisaism.</p>

<p>There remains the class called "Am-ha-aretz,"
or "the people of the land "&mdash;the
"people that knoweth not the law" (John vii.
49). This title denotes, not a definite division,
but simply those amongst the people who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fact were least influenced by the Pharisees, and
least drawn to them. Such would be not only
the careless and indifferent, but also those who,
for higher reasons, did not readily fall in with
the Pharisaic system, or to whom religion as
presented by them was not acceptable. It is
these mainly who are referred to when it is
said that Jesus saw the people "as sheep
without a shepherd" (Mark vi. 34). And it is
only likely that those would most gladly hear
him who were least inclined to follow the
Pharisees.</p>

<p>From this sketch of the composition of the
Jewish nation, in the time of Christ and thereabouts,
it will be seen that the main line of
development is represented by Pharisaism. It
comes down from the time of Ezra, as the
religion of Torah, expounded and administered
by approved teachers, known from the first as
Sopherim. The names &#7716;asidim and Pharisee
denote its most zealous representatives at two
different periods; but they imply no change of
principle, or even of method. What change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
there was is seen in the growth of a body of
teaching, the decisions and interpretations of
successive exponents of Torah, handed on and
repeated from memory, for the instruction of
those who should come after. This is what is
known as the Tradition of the Elders, referred
to in Mark vii. 5 and elsewhere. And when
I come to deal with the theory of Torah in
the next chapter, I shall show how this Tradition
of the Elders was a sign of the continued
vitality of the religion of Torah, not the
gradual strangling of it. At present I am only
concerned with the fact, not with the meaning
of it. The Tradition of the Elders can be traced
in the Mishnah up to the time of the early
Sopherim, not far distant from Ezra; it is the
thread which binds together the development,
through &#7716;asidim and Pharisaism, of the
Jewish religion. And it marks the course of
the main stream of Judaism far on through
the centuries. The Essenes vanished. The
Sadducees were swept away when the Temple
was destroyed. It was the Pharisees who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
alone could or did weather that storm, and
carry the divine treasure of the religion of
Torah into safety. Already, in the time when
Jesus was a boy, Hillel the Babylonian had
applied his genius to the interpretation of
Torah in ways which gave it a fresh power of
ministry to spiritual wants. And when, seventy
years later, the catastrophe came, the man was
ready who should go forth from Jerusalem, and
establish for the ancient religion a "temple
not made with hands." Jo&#7717;anan ben Zaccai
was that man. When he saw that the city
was doomed, he went to the Emperor Vespasian,
and made his submission to the force that could
no longer be resisted (b. Gitt. 56<sup>b</sup>). The
Emperor asked what he should give him,
though he sought no reward. "Give me
Jabneh and its wise men"&mdash;Jabneh being a
town on the coast, where already there were
some of the leading Pharisaic teachers. The
request was granted, and Jo&#7717;anan b. Zaccai
gathered in Jabneh the remnants of the learning
and wisdom of Judaism. There he and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
colleagues repaired the shattered fabric of the
religious life of their people, and adjusted it to
the new conditions. The Temple with all that
belonged to it was gone for ever. But the
Synagogue and the College remained, as the
home both of worship and study; and the
religion of Torah probably gained rather than
lost by being finally cut loose from association
with the Temple cultus. The assembly at
Jabneh took up the task of developing the
religion of Torah, and carrying forward the
Tradition of the Elders, where it had been interrupted
by the war. The teachers to whose
hands that task was now committed were
henceforth known as the Wise; the names
Sopherim and Pharisee were seldom used, but
the essential features of their work remained
unchanged, and it was carried on in the ancient
spirit.</p>

<p>In the interval between the capture of
Jerusalem in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70 and the almost greater
disaster in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 135, when the revolt of Bar
Coch'ba was stamped out, the assembly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the Rabbis met from time to time in Jabneh,
or Lydda; and even during the persecution
which followed on the failure of the last rebellion,
when the Jewish teachers were hunted
up and down, and Akiba, the greatest of them,
was tortured to death, there were still left
those who would carry on the tradition of
their religion. These were young men who
received ordination as Rabbis, when it meant
death to be a Rabbi at all, if he should fall
into the hands of the Romans. It is told
(b. Sanh. 14ª) of R. Jehudah b. Baba, that he
took six of his disciples into a secluded spot
and there ordained them, and that he had
hardly finished before he was discovered by the
soldiers, and fell, stabbed with Roman spears.
The six young men all survived to become
the teachers of the next generation. They
handed on what had been committed to them
as a sacred trust, the religion of Torah, and
the tradition in which its meaning and contents
were set forth in growing fulness and
clearness.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>This takes us out of the period covered
by the New Testament. But I add the few
words necessary to round off the bare account
I have given of the development of Judaism
through the Pharisees.</p>

<p>The Tradition of the Elders, as I have said,
increased in volume and complexity as each
generation of teachers added something to it.
The necessity, therefore, gradually made itself
felt of arranging and systematising the great
mass of traditional matter. This was attempted
first by the R. Akiba just mentioned, then by
R. Meir, one of the six young men ordained
in the time of the persecution. But it was
only carried to completion, after long years of
labour, by R. Jehudah ha-Kadosh, commonly
called "Rabbi," <i>par excellence</i>. He collected
all that he could find of the decisions and
opinions of earlier teachers, sorted them out
under different heads, noted those which were
universally admitted and those which were
doubtful, and thus framed a code of law for
the guidance of all Jews. This collection is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Mishnah; and the text as we have it now
represents, in the main, the code of Rabbi.
There are, of course, interpolations and additions
to it. There is another great collection
known as Tosephta, containing a good deal of
the same material; it is nearly contemporary,
but it has never had the same authority as
the Mishnah. The date of the Mishnah can
be put at about the year 210. Rabbi died in
219. The Mishnah became in its turn the
subject of study in the Rabbinical schools,
and two fresh lines of tradition begin from
this point, each of them starting with a disciple
of Rabbi. One of them is the line of development
of the Mishnah in the Palestinian schools,
of which the chief seat was Tiberias; the other
was the line of development of that same
Mishnah in the Babylonian schools&mdash;Sura,
Nehardea, Pumbeditha, and others. The result
of each process was a mass of commentary on
the Mishnah, and not merely commentary but
accretions of every kind having any sort of
connection with Judaism as a living religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
This development of the Mishnah is in each case
called Gemara. And Mishnah plus Gemara
is the Talmud. There is only one Mishnah,
but there are two Gemaras, differently named
according to the land of their origin. And it
is usual to speak of the Palestinian Talmud
and of the Babylonian Talmud respectively.</p>

<p>Neither of these two was ever completed.
The Palestinian schools, at the end of the
fourth century, had no one left who was capable
of carrying on the work; and in Babylonia,
though much more was done, a final completion
was never reached. After the beginning
of the sixth century nothing more was ever
added to the Talmud; and even of what was
in existence then, not all survives now.</p>

<p class="ht">In the Talmud is contained the main source
for the knowledge of what Pharisaism meant;
because it was made the storehouse in which
all, or nearly all, that was held to be valuable
in the Tradition of the Elders, the explicit
religion of Torah, was stored up. There is a
huge literature contemporary with the Talmud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to which the general name of Midrash is given;
all of it is traditional, and all of it bears on the
religion of Torah, in one way or another.
This is the written deposit of Pharisaism, the
mark which it has left upon the literature of
the world. It is there, and not in the writings
of those who did not understand its ideals or
share its hopes, that its real meaning can alone
be found. Those ideals and hopes first dawned
in Jewish minds under the influence of Ezra.
The Talmud is the witness to show how some
of his countrymen, some of the bravest, some
of the ablest, some of the most pious and
saintly, and a host of unnamed faithful, were
true to those ideals and clung to those hopes;
and how, through good report and ill report,
through shocks of disaster and the ruin of
their state, ground down by persecution, or
torn by faction, steadily facing enemies without
and enemies within, they held on to the religion
of Torah. They have not sought, and
they certainly have not found, the praise of
men for their steadfastness. For these are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Pharisees, and the world has for them only a
contemptuous gibe. Who was it that said:
"For every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account thereof in the day of
judgment"?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smcap">The Theory of Torah</span></h2>


<p>In the preceding chapter I sketched the
historical development of Pharisaism from its
source in the work of Ezra to the time when it
had found its literary expression in the Talmud
and the Midrash. I said that from first to
last what was developed was the religion of
Torah. It is therefore essential to the understanding
of Pharisaism that the reader should,
first, obtain a clear conception of the meaning
of Torah, and, second, that he should bear that
conception always in mind in his further study
of Pharisaism. It will be my task in the
present chapter to show what Torah meant,
and what form the religion of Torah actually,
and perhaps necessarily, assumed. If I succeed,
then the reader will understand how it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that Rabbinical devotion to Torah could express
itself quite naturally in terms which to the unenlightened
Gentile appear to be extravagant&mdash;as,
for instance, when it is said that God studies
Torah for three hours every day (b. A. Zar. 3<sup>b</sup>).</p>

<p>There would be no particular difficulty in
understanding what is meant by Torah, if it
were not that it is commonly supposed that
the word "Law" is the just equivalent of it.
The Greek, alike of the Septuagint and of the
New Testament, renders "Torah" by &#957;&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#962; [Greek: nómos];
and while the translators of the New Testament
rightly rendered &#957;&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#962; [Greek: nómos] by "Law," they
nevertheless perpetuated what was a misconception
on the part of those who used the
Greek word to represent "Torah." It is to
avoid that misconception that I have already
used, and shall continue to use, the word
"Torah" untranslated, as a technical term
whose full implication cannot be expressed in
any one English word. It is true that the
word "torah" is simply and correctly translated
by the word "teaching"; but, as used in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
later Judaism, it denotes a particular kind of
teaching, and also the sum-total of what was
taught as well as the vehicle or medium by
which it was given. It further denotes any
particular portion of that teaching. In short,
it is a word into which the Rabbis compressed
more meaning than can be found in any other
word in their language; and we shall more
readily grasp that varied meaning if we keep
to the word Torah, as being unspoiled by
erroneous associations.</p>

<p>The original meaning, then, of the word
Torah is simply "teaching," any kind of instruction
given by any person to any other
person; for instance, Prov. i. 8, "Forsake not
the 'torah' of thy mother." More specifically,
it was religious teaching, conceived as given
either by God to Israel, or by man to his
fellow-man. Thus, Isa. li. 7, "the people in
whose heart is my Torah" (where the speaker
is God); and, for human instruction, Deut.
xvii. 11, "according to the tenor of the
'Torah' which they shall teach thee," "they"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
being the priests. This last passage gives the
clue to the further developments of the word.
It had been for ages the custom in Israel for
the priests to give instruction to the people
upon matters connected with religion, explanations
of duty, decisions of disputes, intimations
of the will of God. This was, of course, Torah;
and it was Torah which was regarded as being
given by God through human agency. The
Torah which the Lord gave by the hand of
Moses would not originally imply any code or
book, but simply such ancient sayings, precepts
or otherwise, as were traditionally ascribed to
Moses as the great teacher of Israel in the days
of old. The connection of Torah with Moses,
though others might have given Torah as well
as he, had this result, that gradually a body of
traditional teaching was accumulated, ascribed
to him and bearing his name; and the several
attempts to collect and codify these are to be
seen in the various strata of the Pentateuch.
They are mostly in the form of precept and
command, as was only likely, since they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
intended for the guidance of conduct. But
that was not why they were called Torah. If
Moses had taught something that was not
commandment at all, it would still have been
Torah, because it was taught.</p>

<p>In this sense, Israel had never been without
Torah; and the prophet no less than the priest
owned that in it God had continually taught
His people. Prophecy itself was only a form
of Torah, for the prophet spoke the word of
the Lord.</p>

<p>Now, whatever else Ezra introduced that
was new, it was not Torah. If he had
religious teaching to give, as of course he had,
he only followed in the train of the prophets
and priests from Moses downwards. And
when he offered Torah to the people, they
knew what he was referring to. Nor did the
novelty consist in the fact that Ezra made
known to them a larger body of Torah than
they had previously been acquainted with.
It does not greatly matter, for the present
purpose, whether the book which Ezra read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to the people was the Priestly Code, or the
whole Pentateuch substantially, though not
finally, complete. For even if the earlier
documents had not been as yet welded into
one whole with the Priestly Code, they were
nevertheless in existence, and were already
owned as Torah of Moses.</p>

<p>What Ezra did was to lay a much greater
emphasis upon the need of obedience to what
was contained in the book of Torah (or the
books) as being the duty of every Israelite.
What was in fact the collected accretions of
centuries, was regarded by Ezra, and by
all Israel, as Torah from God communicated
by Moses, and therefore entitled to
precedence over any Torah imparted to anyone
else. The book, or books, in which it
was recorded contained all that God had
chosen to reveal for the instruction of His
people. The five books of Moses were the
written form of the Torah. They were
not the Torah itself. It is only for convenience
that the Pentateuch is often called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the Torah. The two are not identical. The
Pentateuch differs from the Torah as the
vessel differs from its contents, even though
there be but one unique vessel in which those
contents are preserved. Ezra, then, offered
for the acceptance of Israel, in the book that
he read to them, what he believed to be the
full revelation which God had made. But he
went beyond those who had preceded him,
beyond even those who had carried through
the reform of which the book of Deuteronomy
is the manifesto, by reason of the stress which
he laid upon personal and individual acceptance
of it. Deuteronomy, no doubt, contained
over and over again the demand, "Thou shalt
observe to do" according to all these commandments,
and it enforced the demand by
the appalling catalogue of curses upon the
disobedient which may be read in the 28th
chapter. But Deuteronomy was written before
the Exile, and Ezra lived after it. The priests
had given Torah, and the prophets had proclaimed
God's revelation of His nature and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
man's relation to Him and consequent duty.
They had been pre-eminently preachers of
righteousness. But yet, in spite of the zeal
of the prophets and the teaching of the priests,
the bitter lesson of the Exile had proved that
Israel had not served his God as he ought to
have done. It was Ezra's function to apply
the lesson of the Exile and to direct the
religious life of Israel into such lines that no
similar disaster should again be experienced;
or rather, that no such sin should again be
committed as had led to that disaster. Ezekiel,
indeed, had been the first to perceive the
necessity of a change in the direction of Israel's
life; but he had lived at a time too early for
a real beginning to be made. Yet it can
hardly be doubted that the seed, which Ezekiel
sowed among the captives in Babylonia, bore
fruit in the ideas which underlay the reformation
of Ezra. When Ezra came forward with
the book of the Torah, he did so not in any
sense as an opponent of the prophets, or as
making a breach between their ideas and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
own. He came forward to enforce their
teaching, to apply it, and to get from it a
larger result of practical righteousness than
it had produced in their time. It was just
because the prophets had so splendidly revealed
God to Israel, had proclaimed to him the full
grandeur of his privilege, that Israel must
now be taught to do his part as he had never
done it before. The greater the privilege the
greater the responsibility. So far from being
at variance with the ideas of the prophets,
Ezra was the one to complete them, or at
least to put his people in the way of completing
them. There is a difference of method between
Ezra and the prophets; there is no difference
of principle. And as the Pharisees and the
later Rabbis did but carry out the method and
the principle of Ezra, they stand in the same
line with him as the legitimate successors and
continuators of the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It may be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
with truth that of the later types of Judaism&mdash;Hellenism,
Apocalyptic, and Rabbinism&mdash;the
last, and only the last, carried on and handed
down the inheritance which the prophets had
left. What Hellenism and Apocalyptic had
to give went to Christianity, so far as it survived
at all.</p>

<p>The purpose of Ezra was to lay stress on
the embodiment, in the practical life of the
individual Jew, of the teaching of the prophets
(including Moses) concerning God and Israel.
The main point for Ezra was that God had
taught certain things&mdash;knowledge of Himself,
knowledge of His will. What had been taught
must be learned and taken to heart, and, so
far as it was of the nature of precept, must be
carried out in practice. It was not enough
to <i>know</i>; the Israelite was required to <i>do</i>
and to <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>The practical application of this idea needed
the acceptance of it on the part of the people,
and further, a definite undertaking to make
certain changes in their manner of life. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
before all, it was necessary that they should,
so far as possible, separate themselves from
the "peoples of the lands" in whose midst they
found themselves, on returning from the Exile.
This is, of course, the meaning of the putting
away of the foreign wives, and the forbidding of
such marriages for the future. The general
programme of the reform is set forth in Neh. x.,
which is nothing more than the logical corollary
of the acceptance of Torah. Among the
points there specified, besides the prohibition
of intermarriage with foreigners, are the
observance of the Sabbath, the payment of the
tax for the service of the house of God, and
the duty of bringing first-fruits and tithes. Of
course these provisions do not cover the whole
duty of the Jew, and they were not intended
to do so. Their purpose was to set up the
Jews as a closed corporation, distinct from the
surrounding peoples, and to provide for the
maintenance of the Jewish cultus. Within
the limits thus drawn, this enclosure marked
off from the Gentile world, the Jew was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
live his whole life, and the Torah was to be his
guide in doing so. The limits were drawn in
order to make it possible for the Jew to live
up to the Torah. The limits themselves are
not part of the Torah; and hence it follows
that a Jew could live with complete loyalty to
the Torah, and yet be but little conscious of
the limits within which he enjoyed his spiritual
freedom and privileges. Unless occasion reminded
him of the fact of separation between
him and the Gentiles, he could give his whole
mind to the immediate concerns of his religious
life&mdash;meditation, prayer, and the doing of his
duties towards God and man. His thought
was not taken up with a painful study of precepts,
but was free to range over the whole
relation in which he stood towards God. The
Torah was his guide to the <i>whole</i> meaning of
that relation, not merely to the performance
of specified duties. And therefore, when Ezra
prevailed on the Jews to become a separate
community, he was not condemning them to
a life of barren legalism, cutting them off from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a free communion with God; he was providing
for them a means whereby they could
enjoy that free communion, defended against
the dangers which, in the past, had been so
disastrous to the religious life of the people.
It is, of course, true that in doing so he was
at the same time cutting the Jews off from
free intercourse with their fellow-men of non-Jewish
race, and thereby restricting their
development as human beings. And the Jews
ever since have paid a heavy price for that
separation. But in Ezra's time free intercourse
with non-Jewish peoples did not seem
at all a desirable thing, if the Jewish people
were to survive. It is indeed difficult to
believe that they would have survived, if the
policy of Ezra had not been carried out. And
if they had not, what would have become of
the Jewish religion? And how would the
great spiritual treasure of the prophets (to say
nothing of the Torah itself) have become
available for those who, in a later age, were
to depend so largely upon it? Whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
policy of separation is to be for ever kept up,
is a question which the future must decide.
But that Ezra saved the Jewish religion and
the Jewish people is hardly open to dispute.</p>

<p>Ezra, then, provided for the Jews an enclosure,
marked off from the Gentile world,
within which to live their religious life; and
he gave them the Torah, as being the full
revelation which God had made through Moses,
for their guide in the life they should thenceforth
live there. Clearly, no one would enter
that enclosure, or remain within it, unless he
really and seriously meant to live on the lines
of Torah. And that is why, from the time of
Ezra, the importance of Torah becomes so
marked, and insistence on it so emphatic; why,
in short, from that time, the Torah dominates
the whole field of religion for those who
followed the lead of Ezra. They virtually
declared that they would stand or fall by the
Torah. For them, the Torah was the medium
through which religion became real to them;
as it were, the glass through which they viewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
all the dealings of God with their own race in
the past, and with mankind in general. This
will be more fully seen when we come to what
the Talmud has to say about Torah. But
that is only the expansion in detail, as pious
imagination dwelt upon the theme, of the idea
which Ezra planted in the mind of his people,
that of the supreme importance of Torah as the
revelation which God had made, the perfect
guide, the source of all that could be known
or required to be known, by him who would
"love God with all his heart, and with all his
strength, and with all his might."</p>

<p>The Jew who followed the lead of Ezra was,
as before, a member of the community of
Israel; but he was, in a far greater degree than
before, aware of his own responsibility for the
right living of his life in relation to God, the
doing and the being of what was pleasing to
Him. The Torah was given to Israel; but it
was none the less addressed to each Jew. And
that, not merely in regard to particular precepts
but in regard to the religious teaching as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a whole. It may be true that nothing in the
Pentateuch rises to the height of spiritual
grandeur attained by the great prophets. It
may be true that their free inspiration denoted
a power and fulness of religious life greater
than could be developed by the Torah as a
body of teaching, or even regarded as a final
revelation. But however sublime the religion
of the great prophets had been, the religion of
the ordinary Israelite had by no means attained
to the same degree of power and fulness.
If it had done so, there would not have been
the collapse of national religious life which
brought about the Exile. The effect of making
the Torah the guide of life, the seat of authority
in religion, was to deepen the spiritual life of
the ordinary Jew; it gave him a stronger sense
of personal responsibility, and opened out to
him regions of religious experience of which
he had seldom if ever been aware. The effect
of thus exalting the Torah was not, as it is so
often said to have been, to cramp and harden
the spiritual nature of the Jew, by confining it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
within definite limits and oppressing it by
precise commands. I would not say that this
never happened; because it is not wise to
assert a universal negative. But it certainly
was not the primary or the usual effect. The
Torah made the religion of Israel personal and
individual to a far greater degree than it had
been before; and it did so by conveying to
the individual Jew not merely the legal precept
but the prophetic fervour, the joy and the
inspiration of personal communion with God
as well as the high privilege of serving Him.
The introduction of the Torah was not the
signal for a decline in the national religious
life, but the beginning of a new and strenuous
advance; and whereas, before, the prophets
had towered high above the mass of the people,
who had remained at a comparatively low level
of spiritual attainment, henceforth there is a
great development of the spiritual nature of
the ordinary people, the individual Jew. There
were no more prophets, because there was no
further need of any prophets. Their work was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
done; and in respect of that part of their work
where they had failed, Ezra and his followers
succeeded. The prophets had declared the
full meaning of the religion of Israel, its
glorious hopes, its triumphant certainties, its
boundless possibilities. The people had heard,
but had too little heeded. Ezra, by means of
the Torah, and expressly and intentionally by
that means, drove all this home to the heart of
the individual Jew, and so wrought it into the
very texture of his religious nature that it has
remained there ever since. It is high time to
put away altogether, as one of the exploded
errors of history, the notion that Ezra, by the
exaltation of the Torah to the supreme place
in Jewish religion, set that religion upon the
down-grade. I believe it to be nearer the
truth to say that after Moses, and Isaiah (or
perhaps Jeremiah), Ezra is the third greatest
man in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be too often repeated that
the Torah, as Ezra understood it, meant divine
teaching upon all and everything that concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
religion. It was not confined to commands,
positive or negative, but included everything
that bore upon religion at all. This is evident
on the face of it; because the contents of the
Pentateuch (which is the written embodiment
of the Torah) include much else beside precept.
As a Rabbi pointed out, long afterwards, if the
Torah had been only precept, it would have
been sufficient to begin it at Exod. xii. 2,
where the first precept occurs. "And why
was it written (Gen. i. 1), 'In the beginning,
God created the heavens and the earth, etc.'?
To show the power of His might" (R. Jitz&#7717;ak,
in Tan&#7717; 4ª). The meaning of which is that the
Torah is a revelation of more than the divine will.</p>

<p>The view that the Torah, as recorded in
the Pentateuch, is the supreme revelation
which God made to Israel, and that it covers
the whole extent of the religious life, theoretical
as well as practical, is implied in the
position which it held in Judaism from the
time of Ezra onwards, and underlies all that
the Talmud says about it. There is no point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in the long line from Ezra to the closing of the
Talmud, at which it can be said: "Here the
conception of the Torah was narrowed into the
meaning of mere legal precept." It was at
no time thus narrowed. And if, as is often
admitted, Judaism, after Ezra and before
Christ, allowed of a considerable degree of
spiritual attainment on the part of those who
were under the Torah, there is no ground for
denying the possibility of such spiritual attainment
on the part of Jews in or after the time
of Christ, because the conception of the Torah
remained the same in essence. What change
there was, between Ezra and the Pharisees and
the later Rabbis in the Talmud, was in the
opposite direction to that of restriction of its
meaning. They realised far more than Ezra
did, or could do, the fulness and richness of the
Torah as a divine revelation; and while they
took a delight in glorifying it on its imperative
side, as embodying divine commands, they
never dreamed of saying that the Torah was
precept and nothing more.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>In his well-known book, <i>Die alt-synagogale
Theologie</i>, p. 24, Weber says: "If we have
to admit that this praise of Torah (in the
Talmudic literature) is entirely in accord with
similar praise of Torah in the Psalms, we
must nevertheless not forget that here (<i>i.e.</i>
in the Talmud) the Torah is praised as Law,
while in Scripture the conception of Torah is
wider and includes all revelation, alike of law
and of salvation."</p>

<p>The opposition here alleged does not exist;
and the statement that it does is the cardinal
error of Weber's mischievous book. For the
right understanding of Pharisaic Judaism, the
fact that Weber is the usually accepted guide
is well-nigh fatal. It will be observed, however,
that Weber admits the wider conception
of the Torah in the later books of the Old
Testament, especially in the Psalms; and that
is all that matters at present. It is of importance
to realise that the spiritual life of
Israel not merely ought to have done, but
actually did increase and develop under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
influence of that Torah which Ezra had exalted
to the supreme place. There are two very
important indications of the truth of this
statement; one is the rise of the Synagogue,
and the other is the growth and completion
of the book of Psalms. It will be no digression,
but an appeal to evidence directly bearing
on the subject, to speak at this point of both
these.</p>

<p>The origin of the Synagogue is to this
extent unknown, that no precise date can be
assigned at which it was first instituted. But
it did not appear in Palestine before the time
of Ezra, and it was already ancient and immemorial
in the time of the Maccabees. It
is possible, and even probable, that it arose
amongst the captives in Babylonia. It is
certain that it spread through the whole Jewish
community in Palestine when it was introduced.
The Synagogue, Beth-ha-keneseth, "meeting-house,"
was a place where Jews assembled for
religious purposes. It is reasonable to suppose
that what first led to the establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
such places, by the captives in Babylonia, was
the fact that they were cut off for an indefinite
time from their native land, and the Temple
of their God. It was not only that they were
prevented by distance from "going up to the
Temple to pray"; it was that the Temple
itself was destroyed, and its services no longer
performed. There was thus no national
worship of God at all. Yet God was still
there, to be worshipped. Trust in Him had
not died out from Jewish hearts when Jerusalem
fell. What more simple and natural,
for all that it was in fact an unheard-of innovation,
than that here and there a company
of brothers in exile should meet together, and
pray to the God of their fathers? So far as
I know, there had never been, in the world's
history, any form of congregational worship till
the Synagogue appeared. Till then, worship
had usually been performed in some temple
or local shrine, and consisted in the offering
of some gift or sacrifice, usually through the
medium of a priest, and accompanied no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by some prescribed prayer. This was done
in the Temple in Jerusalem, while the Temple
yet stood. And the Synagogue did not set
out to do the same thing on a small scale,
but to do something entirely different. The
time came when the Temple service was
restored, and the ancient sacrifices offered
again with the fullest pomp of ritual. But the
Synagogue did not on that account suspend
its operations, or show the least sign of declining
in popular favour.</p>

<p>The idea of the Synagogue was twofold; it
was a place of worship, <i>i.e.</i> congregational
worship, and it was a place of teaching, <i>i.e.</i>
religious teaching. It has kept that twofold
character ever since, or at all events kept it
till long after the Talmudic period. For the
Synagogue had come to stay, and it has continued
down to the present day. Of all the
institutions that man has ever devised, the
one with the longest continuous history is
the Synagogue. And that it answers to a
real and permanent religious need is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by the fact that the Christian religion took
over both the idea and the form of the
Synagogue, in organising its own meetings
for worship, and has retained them ever
since; except where sacrificial ideas, derived
partly from the Temple worship and partly
from pagan ritual, have interfered with and
spoiled the simplicity of the Synagogue type
of service. It is highly remarkable that the
same elements which are familiar in Christian
worship&mdash;hymn, prayer, Scripture reading, and
sermon&mdash;are found in the earliest Synagogue
services so far back as the records go. And
the reason why they have been retained,
practically unaltered, is surely this, that they
have been found to answer their purpose so
well that no change was felt to be needed.
Whoever first devised the form of the Synagogue
service came, no doubt unconsciously,
upon one of the fundamentals of the spiritual
nature of man, made one of the discoveries
which determine the future development of
the race for all time. The Synagogue perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
grew up rather than was intentionally created;
and it was accepted because it so exactly met
the needs of those who first made use of it.
During some twenty-three centuries it has
served the purpose of common worship, both
in its Jewish and its Christian form; and when
it is considered how enormous has been the
influence of the practice of meeting for common
worship, such as the Synagogue first provided
and made possible, then it becomes highly
significant that the Synagogue appeared in
close connection with the labours of Ezra and
the new emphasis laid on the Torah. Whether,
on the supposition that the Synagogue arose
on Babylonian soil, it owed its origin to the
conception of Torah as Ezra understood it,
we have no means of knowing. But it is
certain that its rapid spread in Palestine took
place when the idea of Torah was already
made dominant. And the Synagogue was
naturally adapted to embody that idea. As
the Torah was the revelation which God had
made to Israel, the study of it and the practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
application of it were both associated with the
"house of meeting." To study it was to
ponder the meaning of the revelation. And
to practise it was, amongst other things, to
worship the God who had given it. The
Synagogue was intended to develop through
religious fellowship the whole nature of those
who met there, spiritual and moral, and by
no means only intellectual. And even if the
Torah which they studied had been nothing
but precepts, yet these included a personal
devotion to the service of God which was
practically unthinkable without worship of
Him. It was as natural that those who met in
the Synagogue should join in prayer together,
as that they should read or hear the book of
the Torah, and should edify one another by
expounding its contents. That is what they
did; and the Synagogue did not fail to become
a most important factor in deepening and
strengthening the spiritual life of the people
at large.</p>

<p>Now if the effect of the exaltation of Torah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
due to Ezra, had been, as it is usually said to
have been, gradually to harden and cramp the
spiritual freedom of the Jewish mind, then
either the Synagogue would have ceased to
minister in any way to spiritual needs, or else it
would have represented a protest against the
deadening influence of Torah. But in actual
fact there has never been, at all events till
quite recent years, any such opposition between
the Synagogue and the religion of Torah. On
the contrary, it was precisely the religion of
Torah which the Synagogue, through all these
centuries, has existed to promote; and it was
the Synagogue, so inspired, which served as the
type and model of Christian worship. The
Synagogue is one of the first-fruits of that
Judaism which, under the lead of Ezra, took
its stand upon the Torah.</p>

<p>Further evidence in the same direction,
namely, that the tendency of the religion of
Torah was not towards spiritual decline, is
afforded by the book of Psalms. That evidence
would be more cogent than it is, if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
possible to fix with certainty the date of every
Psalm. That cannot be done; but the fact
remains that the collection of the Psalms, and
the use of that collection as a lyrical expression
of devotion, belong to the time after, and not
before, the age of Ezra. It is often said that
the book of Psalms is the hymn-book of the
second Temple; and I do not challenge the
general correctness of that statement. But
some, at all events, of the Psalms seem to be
less adapted to the Temple service than to
that of the Synagogue. I mean that those
utterances of intensely personal devotion which
make the Psalms so wonderful a treasure of
spiritual experience, are much more in keeping
with the simple worship of the Synagogue
than with the stately and official celebrations
of the Temple. It might indeed be said that
some of the Psalms are too personal even for
the congregational worship of the Synagogue,
if we did not know, from common usage, that
hymns of that character are constantly sung in
Christian worship. There is hardly any one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the Psalms which could not have been quite
well sung in the Synagogue; while there are
many which have no obvious fitness for the
service of the Temple. But, in any case, it
was not until after Ezra had made Torah the
dominant factor in Judaism that the book of
Psalms was collected and arranged, and in part
composed, as we have it now. It contains
hymns of an older date, in some cases perhaps
a much older date. And it is possible that
some smaller collections had been made in
times before Ezra. But there are several
Psalms which quite clearly owe their origin to
the idea of Torah as the supreme revelation,
besides others which bear witness to the
influence of that idea; while the collection of
the whole is best explained as due to the need,
first brought to the Jewish consciousness by
the Synagogue, of some means of giving united
expression to the thoughts and feelings of a
worshipping multitude. Of course it is not
here implied that the collection or production
of the book of Psalms took place immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
after the time of Ezra. The collection may
have only been completed as late as the first
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But the point is that the whole
was collected, and much of it composed, under
the influence of the religious ideas associated
with Ezra and the Torah. And it should be
observed that the later be the date assigned to
the composition of some of the Psalms, and
the final collection of the whole of them, the
stronger is the evidence that the religion of
Torah was not the unspiritual formalism that
it is often supposed to have been.</p>

<p>I shall have more to say about the Psalms,
as evidence for the meaning of the religion of
Torah, in the last chapter, in which I shall deal
with Pharisaism as a spiritual religion. For
the present enough, perhaps, has been said to
show that the Judaism to which Ezra gave its
distinguishing character by raising the Torah
to its supreme place there, was thereby enriched
and not impoverished on its spiritual side; it
did not sink but rise, it became not more
shallow and poor, but more full and deep, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
greater power than it ever had before as a
determining factor in individual life.</p>

<p>It may be objected, at this point, "All this
may be very true, in regard to the religion of
Ezra, as conditioned by Torah; but does it
hold good in regard to the religion of the
Pharisees, of whom, in this chapter, nothing
has as yet been said? Ezra may have been
such as has been described; but it is the
Pharisees who are commonly said to have been
mere legalists in their ethics, and formalists in
their worship." I am quite ready to meet that
challenge; and it was for the purpose of preparing
to meet it that I have been so careful
to make clear the conception of Torah implied
in the work of Ezra, and its effect upon the
religion of those who followed his lead.</p>

<p>As has been said already, there was no
divergence in principle between Ezra and the
Pharisees. Both accepted with entire assent
the conception of the Torah as the supreme
revelation made by God to Israel; and they
owned in like manner, with entire assent, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
duty of conforming in thought, word, and
deed to the divine teaching therein contained.
In what, then, did the Pharisees differ from
Ezra? In what directions was development
possible from the idea of Torah as he conceived
it? And in particular, what line of development
was still open to the Pharisees when
they first became a distinct element in the
Jewish national life?</p>

<p>In the time between Ezra and the Maccabees
that provision had been made of the Synagogue
worship, to which reference has already been
made; and within the lines of a liturgy whose
simple beginnings are ascribed to the Men of
the Great Synagogue, and which was further
enlarged by the piety of later generations, that
piety continued to find expression in public
worship. Private prayer never confined itself
to stated forms; and private prayer was
always an essential element in the religion of
Torah. It must never be forgotten, that in
all the developments of Pharisaism and
Rabbinism on the lines of theology and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
practical conduct of life, the spiritual and
devotional side is always involved. The men
who built up the huge fabric of Talmudic
casuistry were men who prayed to their Father
in Heaven (calling Him by that name), and
who, in simplicity of heart, "worshipped him
in spirit and in truth." If this is challenged,
(though it would not be challenged by anyone
who really knows the Rabbis), then I ask,
were the great men who built up the equally
huge fabric of Christian doctrinal theology
men in whom the spiritual nature was
atrophied? Let Augustine answer for his
brethren among the Christians; and if his
answer be allowed, (and no one who has read
the <i>Confessions</i> will dispute it), then let
it be allowed that R. Akiba, a double-dyed
Pharisee if there ever was one, and a master of
Halachah, may also have known "the deep
things of God," and "walked in the light of
His countenance."</p>

<p>The development of the religion of Torah
from Ezra to the Pharisees, and on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Talmud, took place along two main lines, it
being understood that through all the spiritual
and devotional side was ministered to. The
two lines of development are indicated by two
words, of which I have just mentioned one&mdash;H&#259;l&#257;chah
and H&#259;gg&#257;dah. To grasp the
significance of these terms is essential for the
right understanding of Pharisaism. I will not
give a definition of them, just at this point,
but will rather describe the two methods by
which the Torah was interpreted, and for
which these two names were chosen.</p>

<p>The Torah, as recorded in the Pentateuch,
was set up by Ezra as the supreme revelation
made by God to Israel. It was Teaching
intended to be learned. Now one of the first
things that must be learned by any man who
would serve God is <i>How</i> he shall serve Him.
What shall he refrain from doing? How
shall he know, if he is in doubt, whether he
ought to do <i>this</i> or <i>that</i>? And again, many
things are done as being customary; there are
usages, observances, ceremonial acts of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the origin is not known. Are these to be
approved or condemned, when tried by the
standard of the right service of God?</p>

<p>On the lines laid down by Ezra, and followed
by the Pharisees and the Rabbis, the answer
to questions such as these was to be sought in
the Torah. Answers to some of them were
found at once. In many passages, the words
were explicit: "Thou shalt do <i>so</i>," or "Thou
shalt not do <i>so</i>." In other passages, minute
directions were given for the performance of
certain acts. But cases would arise which
were not expressly dealt with in the written
Torah; and in such cases it became the duty
of those who had most deeply studied it, to
give a decision according to what they believed
to be the intention of the Torah. They would
infer from what it enjoined in a given set of
circumstances, what it would enjoin in a
somewhat different set of circumstances. This
is what the early Sopherim did, and probably
Ezra himself. And these decisions were on
the one hand interpretations of the Torah, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on the other hand rules of conduct, to be
applied as occasion might require. On both
accounts they were carefully handed down,
for the guidance and instruction of posterity.
This is the Tradition of the Elders, and it
extends from Ezra to the closing of the
Talmud.</p>

<p>Now let us examine that tradition at
some suitable point, say the beginning of our
era, when Pharisaism was fully established.
The Tradition of the Elders had become by
that time a considerable body of decisions,
originally given by way of interpreting the
Torah so as to apply it in particular cases.
These decisions were not written down, but
preserved in memory. A Pharisee would say
that all these were part of the Torah. They
were not something added on to it, of merely
human as opposed to divine authority. They
were successive unfoldings of what had been
hidden in the Torah from the beginning. The
particular teacher who had given such and such
an interpretation, thereby rendered explicit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
what had till then been implicit in the Torah.
The Torah was not merely the written word
of the Pentateuch, but the divine thought
behind it. And to interpret the Torah was
not to read something fresh <i>into</i> the written
word, but to get something fresh <i>out</i> of it. If
a Pharisee were asked, Where is the Torah to be
found? he would answer: "The written word
and the unwritten tradition together make up
the Torah." And he would further say that
the unwritten was more important than the
written, because the unwritten unfolded what
was concealed in the written, and extended its
application. But it was all the Torah; and
however far the process might be extended,
however detailed the interpretation might come
to be, it would still all be the Torah. For the
Torah was in itself inexhaustible, being the
full revelation that God had made. And all
the drawing forth and unfolding of its meaning
was but the bringing into the consciousness of
men what was and had been in the Torah from
the beginning. This is the theory of Torah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as it was certainly held by the Pharisees, and
embodied in the Talmud. Whether Ezra
himself held it, there is no evidence to show,
and I do not claim that he did. But it is clear
that once the Torah is made supreme, this
is one of the possible lines along which that
idea could be developed. There are no doubt
other lines; but the main characteristic of the
Pharisees and of the Rabbis is that they
followed this line, and no one can say that they
did not do their work thoroughly.</p>

<p>What it amounts to is this, that the Torah
was to be made, not merely in theory but in
practice, a complete guide to life. The aim
was to learn, from what God had revealed, His
will in regard to every slightest action that a
man might do. That could be learned from
the Torah; and if it could be, it ought to be.
No amount of study was too great, if, by that
means, something more might be learned of
how God willed that a man should live. Every
fresh interpretation of the Torah, when once
accepted as valid, was an extension of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
meaning, or rather a transference of its meaning
from the region of the unknown to the region
of the known.</p>

<p>The result of this process was a detailed
statement that such and such and such actions
were to be done by anyone who would rightly
serve God, because they were what God Himself
had taught in the Torah, as being His will.
This detailed rule of right conduct is what is
denoted by the name <i>Halachah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Halachah is the most conspicuous element
in Pharisaism, partly because it was the object
of its authors' most close and continuous
thought, and partly because its results were
immediately visible in the actions which it
prescribed. It was the Halachah which gave
rise to the common opinion that Torah is the
same as Law. It is the Halachah which has
laid the Pharisees open to so much misrepresentation
and obloquy. And, if there was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
thing more than another that a Pharisee would
extol as divine, it was the Halachah; because
it was to him the express direction of God how
rightly to serve Him.</p>

<p>Evidently the greatest care would be needed
in the interpretation of the Torah, to draw from
it the right conclusion. If the result&mdash;the
Halachah&mdash;was to be accepted as the divine
teaching, made explicit upon such and such a
point, it could not be left to chance or caprice
to determine the form in which it should be
expressed. It was not open to any teacher to
give his own interpretation upon some point
and straightway to say, "This is the Halachah,"
<i>i.e.</i> this is the Torah made explicit upon this
subject. What was to be regarded as Halachah
was only determined after careful deliberation,
guided by the recorded opinion of earlier
teachers, where known, and also by recognised
rules of interpretation. The end proposed in
such discussion was either to define in minuter
detail some general rule of conduct derived
from the Torah, or else to connect some already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
existing usage with the Torah so as to show
that it had divine sanction. The masters of
Halachah were not engaged upon the construction
<i>de novo</i> of a system of ethics or a system
of law. They were engaged in adjusting to
the standard of Torah all the actions of life, so
that in every one of them the divine will might
be carried out. And when it appeared that
such and such was the real meaning of Torah
upon a given point, the Halachah ascertained
by valid methods, then they were not free to
decide otherwise upon that point. Which is
only to say, what everyone must say, that he
is not entitled to go against the authority
which he personally regards as supreme.</p>

<p>The Halachah covered part of the ground
which is usually occupied in a nation's life by
the civil and criminal law. And this is another
reason for the common identification of Torah
with Law. Law there must be for the regulations
of social life, the performance of contracts,
the prevention of crime, and the like. The
Jews needed a civil and criminal law, as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
civilised people needs it. And though in
certain respects they were subject to the
Roman law, (at all events in the time of the
Pharisees and the Rabbis), yet they devised a
system of their own, because they would have
their law based on the Torah. The Roman
government they obeyed from compulsion;
to the Torah they gave the full allegiance of
heart and will. The Halachah accordingly is,
to a large extent, a system of civil and criminal
law based upon, or derived from, the Torah,
and resting for its sanction upon the divine
revelation therein contained. And if the
Halachah, in dealing with such subjects as
must be dealt with in a code of civil and
criminal law, goes into minute detail, makes
subtle distinctions, draws very fine lines between
what is and what is not lawful, it only does
what any adequate system of law is bound to
do. And to say that the mass of detail and
minute precept of the Halachah was, or must
have been, oppressive to the ordinary Jew, is
as true, or untrue, as to say that the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Englishman is oppressed by the mass of detail
and minute precept in the body of statute and
common law by which his actions as a citizen
are regulated, and which he is presumed to
know. In the one case, as in the other, certain
lines are defined by a recognised authority, for
the regulation of action; but for any given
person, it is seldom that he will be in a position
to feel the constraint, or expressly to seek the
permission, of the greater number of the laws
under which he lives. If he is in that position,
then the Englishman under the statute and
common law, equally with the Pharisee under
the Halachah, acknowledges a rule of conduct
having authority over him, and not to be
disobeyed with impunity. And the main
difference is that, to the Jew, the authority of
the Halachah was the authority of the Torah,
and the Torah was the revelation of God. So
that, to the Jew, the code of civil and criminal
law was specifically sacred in a way that it is
not to the Englishman.</p>

<p>But the Halachah, as the reader will wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
remind me, came very much more closely home
to the Jew than a code of civil and criminal
law could do. It was the rule of his private
and domestic life, it defined his conduct both
towards God and his fellow-man. Certainly it
did. And the Pharisee would say, "Why not?
Do I not need to serve God in everything I
do, however small? And if the Torah can
teach me exactly&mdash;yes, very exactly&mdash;what is
most pleasing to Him, shall I not thankfully
receive that teaching, and the more of it the
better?" On this theory, it can easily be seen
that there is no real distinction of great and
small, important and trivial, in the things that
are done in accordance with Halachah, because,
in each case, what was done was regarded as
a doing of God's will. In themselves, and
apart from that, actions were trivial or important,
great or small, and the Pharisees knew
perfectly well that they were. But the Pharisee
never regarded the mere doing of the action as
sufficient; in all and every case there must be
the purpose of serving God, the intention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
pleasing Him. If he were assured that God
had directed such and such a thing to be done,
in a given case, then he would not say, "This is
a trivial thing," or "This is a great thing"; but,
"This is precisely what God would have me do
at this moment and under these circumstances,"
and he felt a joy in doing it as exactly as he
could. All this is widely different from what
Christians are accustomed to, in determining
their actions; but my object is to make clear
the point of view of the Pharisees, and to show
that on the lines of their theory they were
perfectly justified in those precise definitions
of conduct, even in matters which on other
lines would be considered trifling. However
small might be the details upon which the
Halachah was defined, it was still Torah that
enjoined the doing of the action in this way
and not in that way, though, on the face of it,
there might seem to be no reason to do it
in one way rather than another. And the
authority of Halachah was the will of God.
It is easy to pick out from the Mishnah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
instances of minute regulation upon points of
no apparent importance&mdash;such, for instance, as
the rules for dealing with an egg laid upon the
Sabbath. If a Pharisee were challenged upon
that, or any similar case, he would say: "The
Torah, the divine revelation, extends over the
whole of life; and its principles, when drawn
out and applied to that particular case, yield
the results stated in the Halachah, bearing
thereon. The divine will is taught me in
regard to that; and what concerns me is the
doing of the divine will, and not the smallness
of the occasion in regard to which I do it."</p>

<p>The duties enjoined in the Halachah were
called "Mitzv&#333;th," <i>i.e.</i> commandments. And
the essence of a "mitzvah" was that it was a
thing which God willed to have done. It
was an occasion of service, a means offered to
man by which he could in a given instance
please God. Therefore the Pharisee delighted
in being able to perform a "mitzvah"; and
it never occurred to him that he was burdened
by the weight or oppressed by the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of them. "The 'Mitzv&#333;th,'" said a famous
Rabbi, "were only given in order to purify
Israel. The things commanded made no
difference to God" (Rab, in Ber. R. § 44,
p. 89ª). They were so many opportunities
given, by the sheer kindness of God, for man
to do his Maker's will. Why God should be
pleased to direct that such things should be
done just in that way and in no other, it was
not for man to inquire. All that he had to
do was to take the opportunity, and serve God
in the manner which God enjoined. Merely
to do the action, without the conscious assent
of his will and the devotion of his heart, was
no fulfilment of his duty; for what God
desired was the harmony of the human soul
with Himself in willing obedience, and not
that, for instance, just 2000 cubits and no
more should be the extent of a Sabbath
day's walk.</p>

<p>R. Jo&#7717;anan b. Zaccai, a contemporary of
Jesus, was once asked what was the reason
for performing all the ritual of the sacrifices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and the other minutiæ of the ceremonial law.
He answered: "A corpse does not defile, and
waters do not cleanse. But it is a decree of
the King of kings. The Holy One, blessed
be He, hath said, 'I have ordained my statute;
I have decreed my decree. Man is not entitled
to transgress my decree.' As it is written
(Num. xix. 2), 'This is the decree of the Torah'"
(Pesikta 40<sup>b</sup>). That is a far-reaching saying,
and gives the clue to the whole meaning of the
Halachah, as the rule of right conduct deduced
from the Torah, and applied by the Pharisees.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a theory like that lends
itself to abuse, because it makes a severe
demand for constant devotion on the part of
the man who lives under it. Undoubtedly it
could, and in some cases it did, lead to that
mere formalism and hypocrisy which have
been charged upon the Pharisees as a class.
The Pharisees themselves were perfectly well
aware of the danger, and that it was not
always successfully averted. But most distinctly,
such formalism and hypocrisy were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
only the perversion of Pharisaism and not
inherent in it. And not only so, but for the
Pharisees as a class, on their own showing in
the Talmud, the Halachah, with its abundant
"Mitzv&#333;th," was felt to be a help and not a
hindrance to him who would walk with God,
a joy and not a burden.</p>

<p>The Pharisees, as was explained in the
previous chapter, were those in their time who
interpreted most strictly the Torah which in
some degree all Jews recognised. It was they
who worked out the Halachah, as it was they
who carried out its principle into the minutest
details of practice. On their theory of Torah,
it was clearly their duty to be as precise as
they were in their food and their dress, in the
"tithing of mint, anise, and cumin," the
wearing of their phylacteries just <i>so</i> and
not otherwise, in their scrupulous regard to
"clean" and "unclean," "lawful" and "forbidden,"
and the like. And it was only for
the sake of being in a position to carry out
more fully what they deemed to be the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of God, in all these and many other matters,
that they separated themselves from those
who were less careful, and formed themselves
into groups, societies, companionships, as they
called them (&#7716;ab&#363;r&#333;th). That separation is
indicated by the name applied to them,
Pher&#363;shim, or Pharishaia in the common
Aramaic speech. Their own name for themselves
and each other was "&#7716;aberim," "companions,"
as they were "banded together for
a full obedience" to what God had enjoined
in the Torah.</p>

<p>It is easy to make Pharisaism appear
ridiculous, a mere extravagance of punctilious
formalism. But that is only possible to those
who look at it from a point of view which is
not that of its devoted adherents, or who
judge it by a standard which they never recognised.
Pharisaism is entitled to be judged
according to what the Pharisees themselves
meant by it, and its worth to be estimated by
what they found in it, without comparison
with other and widely different conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the theory or practice of the service of God.
I shall make no such comparisons, either now
or later. My whole object is to present
Pharisaism as I believe it really to have been
to the Pharisees themselves, who, whatever
else they were, were in deadly earnest about
it all, and gave even to that Halachah, which
more than anything else has brought scorn
and ridicule upon them, the patient labour of
at least six centuries.</p>

<p>I believe that, if the Pharisees had had
nothing more than the Halachah, they would
still have made a religion out of it. I mean,
if they had developed from the Torah, which
was to them the supreme revelation, only
its Mitzv&#333;th, they would still have been able
to find in it some satisfaction for the spiritual
wants of their souls. But they had much else,
as will be shown in more detail in subsequent
chapters. It was their task, or rather their
absorbing delight, to elaborate the Halachah,
to make it an ever more perfect exposition of
the divine will in regard to the conduct at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
least of Israel; as it was their joy, in the
obeying of those precepts, to "walk humbly
with their God," as they certainly did. But
it should be borne in mind that in addition to
the Halachah, with its strenuous and salutary
discipline of thought and action; there was
the whole range of meditation upon divine
things&mdash;speculation, imagination, inquiry into
the mysteries of nature and human experience,
devout wonder at the ways of God and the
marvels of His world, all, by the light which
He had given in His Torah. For great as the
Halachah was, and divine and holy, the Torah
was greater, for in it God had given all that
He had to give. "Greater," said a Rabbi, "is
one single word of Torah, than all the 'Mitzv&#333;th'
contained in it." And another: "All
the world is not equivalent to one single word
of Torah" (j. Peah. 15<sup>d</sup>), meaning that the
beholding of the perfect revelation of God is
more than the realisation in action of a part of
it. Again, extravagance, it will be said. Yet
only the extravagance of exalting in spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
word that which is owned as supreme in
thought. The phrases may be to non-Jewish
ears devoid of serious meaning; but in that
way the Pharisees chose to express what in
their hearts they owned as fully and perfectly
divine, that Torah which to them was wisdom
from God, the revelation of all truth, goodness,
power, and love. It was to them the very
expression of the mind and thought of God;
and that is what they meant when they said
that God looked upon the Torah when He
created the world (Tanh. 2<sup>b</sup>), or that He
Himself studies the Torah every day. It is
His self-communing made known to man.</p>

<p>All this, which covers the whole field that
is occupied in other religions by doctrinal and
speculative theology, was included in the
Torah and formed part of the religion of those
who owned it as supreme. And all this had its
place in their thought along with the Halachah.</p>

<p>And at the heart of those same Pharisees
there was the piety which sought and found
God in the worship of the Synagogue and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
home, which looked to Him with love and
humble trust, and knew Him to be not far
off but very near, no mere abstract power, no
hard taskmaster, but the Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>These things I believe to be true of the
Pharisees; not of every individual, just as
one would not say of every Christian that the
full glory of his religion was realised either <i>in</i>
him or <i>by</i> him, but true as the full expression
of what Pharisaism meant, and true in a
larger measure as the experience of those who
professed it.</p>

<p>Beneath all that outward guise of unfamiliar
phrase and uncongenial method, so far removed
from all that to Christians seems the natural
expression of religion, there was nevertheless
the communion of living souls with the living
God; and however different was the way in
which they felt called to walk, from that in
which other men walk, in that way they
steadfastly continued; and, knowing in their
hearts that God was with them, they "trusted
in Him and were not ashamed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smcap">Pharisaism and Jesus</span></h2>


<p>It is from the New Testament that the ordinary
Christian reader gets his ideas about the
Pharisees. There is mention in the Gospels
of frequent encounters between Jesus and the
Pharisees; and the Epistles of Paul contain
much severe comment on the Pharisaic conception
of religion. No one, who desires to
understand what the Pharisees themselves
meant by their religion, can afford to pass by,
without careful examination, these records of
unfavourable criticism; and he must enter
upon such examination not by any means with
the preconceived intention of confuting the
critics or of agreeing with them, but simply for
the purpose of getting to know why there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
such criticism, and what truth lay on each side
in the controversy. With this object, I shall
devote one chapter to the study of the opposition
between the Pharisees and Jesus, and
another to that between Pharisaism and the
teaching of Paul. Incidentally, it will be
possible to find room for various points which
bear upon what has been said in the foregoing
chapters.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that to discuss the relation
of the Pharisees to Jesus is to tread upon
delicate ground; for, whatever Jesus was, the
place which he holds in the thought and
reverence of Christians is shared by no one
else; and it is less easy to say the right thing
when he is regarded as a party in a controversy
than when he is contemplated as in himself
supremely great. It is less easy, because the
controversy was one in which sharp and bitter
things were said on both sides; and to regret
that they were said, and still more to suggest
that they were said without sufficient warrant,
is to cast inevitable reflections on those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
said them. It is easy to say that the Pharisees
were wrong&mdash;that is only what is expected of
them; it is another thing to say that Jesus was
wrong, that even he did less than justice to
his opponents, and, in his intercourse with
them, showed upon occasion qualities which
were extremely human but not obviously
divine. I yield to no one in my reverence for
Jesus; he is, to me, simply the greatest man
who ever lived, in regard to his spiritual
nature. Some may think that too little to say
of him; others may think it too much. I do
not stay to argue the point; I only wish to
make clear, beyond any misunderstanding, my
own position. What I have to do at present
is to deal with the fact that between Jesus,
being such as I have indicated, and the
Pharisees, there was an opposition of thought
and principle too great to be resolved into
harmony; and I wish to study that opposition,
so as to judge fairly&mdash;that is, without prejudice
one way or the other&mdash;the real meaning of it.
If, on the one side, the verdict is expressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the phrase, "Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,"
on the other it is summed up in the assertion,
to be found in the Talmud, "Jesus practised
magic and led astray and deceived Israel" (b.
Sanh. 107<sup>b</sup>). To say offhand that one of those
assertions is true and the other false is merely
to beg the question. It is more to the purpose
to understand how it came about that they
were said. That such a statement should be
made about Jesus is to Christians hard to
endure. They feel it to be unjust and untrue.
That such a statement should be made about
the Pharisees is to Jews hard to endure. They
feel it to be unjust and untrue. They are
the weaker party, and they have the right
to be heard.</p>

<p>In view of the sharp contrast expressed in
the two sayings just referred to, it might seem
that the Pharisees and Jesus had nothing in
common. And indeed the final breach was
inevitable and irreparable. Religion as the
Pharisee conceived it could not come to terms
with religion as Jesus conceived it. As to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
I will say more presently. But it is well to
bear in mind, and even to emphasise, the fact
that there was nevertheless a considerable
amount of common ground between them,
much more than is usually supposed. With a
great deal of what Jesus said about God, and
about man's relation to Him, no Pharisee
would feel disposed to quarrel, or, so far as the
evidence goes, ever did quarrel. The discussions
in the Gospels did not turn, for instance,
on the question whether Jesus should or
should not have referred to God as the Father
in Heaven, or whether forgiveness was God's
sure answer to repentance. No Pharisee ever
challenged him on either point, or on many
another of the directly religious and ethical
sayings which he uttered. A Pharisee could
not so have challenged him without disowning
his own religion. Modern Jewish historians
not unnaturally lay much stress upon the
similarity between the teaching of Jesus and
that of the Rabbis, at all events the best of
them; and that similarity cannot be denied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
whatever may be the explanation of it. Moreover,
it is not merely a similarity of phrase,
though no doubt in some cases it is nothing
more. That proverbial sayings should be used
alike by Jesus and the Rabbis is not wonderful.
Such were, for instance: "It is enough for a
disciple to be as his master" (b. Ber. 58<sup>b</sup>); "With
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to
you again" (Sot. i. 7); "Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof" (b. Ber. 9<sup>b</sup>); "Physician,
heal thyself" (Ber. R. xxiii. 4), which Jesus
himself mentions as a familiar proverb
(Luke iv. 23).</p>

<p>These were part of the common stock of
daily speech, and are no evidence either for or
against a similarity between the ideas of Jesus
and those of the Pharisees. But when Jesus
said, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is
at hand," he was referring to what was already
familiar to his hearers, and had been, long
before John the Baptist had begun to deliver
his message. And when the Sermon on the
Mount was first spoken, it was not all strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and new to the hearers. The general character
of the sayings there grouped together is
thoroughly Jewish; so much so that one could
hardly imagine a Greek saying them. There
are differences, certainly, between the sayings
contained in the Sermon on the Mount and
the Rabbinical parallels to them; and for some
of them no Rabbinical parallels can be found.
But, take it altogether, the Sermon on the
Mount would seem to a Pharisee to be very
like what he believed already. Even the
Lord's Prayer would not be wholly new.
Certainly some of its phrases can be paralleled
in the Rabbinical literature; though no less
certainly there are others which cannot. For
the prayer as a whole, there is no parallel in
Jewish sources&mdash;a very significant fact. But
"Our Father which art in Heaven" is Jewish;
so also, "Hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom
come"; "Give us this day our daily
bread"; "Forgive us our debts"; "Deliver
us from the evil." I am not sure about "Lead
us not into temptation." And if "Thy will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
be done" means the same in the Lord's Prayer
as it meant when uttered in Gethsemane, there
is no parallel to it in Jewish sources.</p>

<p>This carries us into the very heart of the
religion of Jesus. And in regard to these
fundamental beliefs there was no disagreement
between him and the Pharisees. I am
perfectly well aware that the Rabbinical
parallels, even those most complete, are found
in literature which is later than Jesus, and I
shall rightly be challenged to show on what
ground I hold that these later Jewish dicta
represent the beliefs of the Pharisees in the
time of Jesus. I do not agree with Jewish
scholars who say that Jesus borrowed them all
from the Rabbis of his time. A man of such
independent thought as Jesus certainly was,
would hardly need to go in search of such
ideas, as not having them already himself.
It is inconceivable that Jesus should never
have thought of calling God "Our Father in
Heaven" until Hillel or Shammai had instructed
him to do so. The point scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
needs to be laboured. I put on one side
altogether the theory that Jesus was indebted
to the Rabbis of his time for the beliefs, and
the verbal forms of them, which he shared
with the Pharisees.</p>

<p>But with no less decision must the theory
be rejected according to which these various
beliefs and phrases were borrowed from Jesus.
If they had been, <i>i.e.</i> if Pharisees who heard
Jesus say these things had adopted them as
their own, and even to some extent made them
current in their own religious teaching, it is
perfectly certain they would never have been
allowed into the Talmud. Suppose, for instance
(which is what a great many people
suppose), that Jesus had been the first to use
the phrase, "Our Father which art in Heaven,"
so that to Jewish ears that had been entirely
unknown until he used it. In that case, the
origin of the term would have been perfectly
well remembered; and the feeling against
Jesus in Pharisaic circles was far too strong to
allow, for a moment, the use of a phrase known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to have been coined by "the Sinner of Israel."
The earliest occurrence of the term in the
Mishnah, so far as I know, is at the end
of chapter ix. of the treatise Sotah; and
there the person who uses it is R. Eliezer b.
Horkenos. This particular Rabbi is very well
known. He lived at the end of the first
century of our era. He got into trouble on
one occasion; and the reason of his trouble,
according to his own admission, was that he
had unwittingly praised something that was
told him, and which he afterwards learned was
a saying of Jesus. He was filled with horror
at the thought that he could ever have
approved anything which had emanated from
that teacher. Now R. Eliezer himself was
probably too young to have seen and heard
Jesus; but his old master, R. Jo&#7717;anan b.
Zaccai, was a contemporary, and must have
witnessed the tragedy in Jerusalem. If
Jesus had invented the term, "Our Father in
Heaven," that fact would be well within the
knowledge of R. Eliezer, and he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cut off his right hand sooner than have used
the phrase. Instead of that, he used it with
devout intention: "Who is there on whom
to lean, except our Father who is in Heaven?"
It was a phrase which expressed the ground of
trust in God. And neither to himself nor to
anyone else did it occur that he was using a
phrase either recent or suspicious in its origin.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>All this goes to show that there cannot
have been any borrowing from Jesus on the
part of those who recorded in the Talmud
sayings similar to his, or who used phrases
implying similar beliefs. It is just conceivable
that slight and unimportant sayings of his
might have been picked up and made current
amongst the Rabbis. But that phrases so
important and so numerous as those which are
offered as parallels to the teaching of Jesus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
should have been borrowed from him, is, to
anyone who knows the Talmud at all, a sheer
impossibility.</p>

<p>There remains, accordingly, this alternative,
that such phrases represent what was familiar
to and accepted by both Jesus and the
Pharisees, as ground truths about which there
was no dispute. Jesus did not explain, as he
had no need to explain to his hearers, why he
called God the Father in Heaven. He took
it for granted that they knew whom he
referred to and what he meant. And no
Scribe ever asked him to explain his meaning.
It is clear that, wherever it came from, the
term "Father in Heaven," as applied to God,
was not new in the time of Jesus. It was
part of the common stock of religious ideas,
a natural element in the Jewish religion of
that time. When and how it first came into
use I do not know. It is not found, in so
many words, in the Old Testament or the
Apocrypha, though there is a broad hint of
it in Isa. lxiii. 16, "Surely Thou art our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Father, etc." If it be (and who will deny
that it is?) one of the great watchwords of
spiritual religion, then observe that it can
only have come into use in the time between
the Maccabees and Jesus; and no other source
for it can be deemed so probable as the Synagogue,
the home of the religion of Torah.</p>

<p>And much the same argument applies to
the rest of what can be shown to be similar
in the religious ideas of Jesus and those of
the Rabbis. They cannot have been borrowed
from Jesus. They were known in his time
because he gave utterance to them, and was
not challenged for doing so. They were
known and devoutly believed by the Talmudic
Pharisees; there is no indication of their
being a novelty. They must therefore represent
substantially what was held and
believed by the Pharisees in and before the
time of Jesus.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be argued that Jesus put
a deeper meaning into the common terms
than the Pharisees did. But this is extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
difficult to prove; and merely to say that he
did is to beg the question. Who would
venture to say that all Christians put precisely
the same meaning upon the common terms
which they employ, or that a given term will
not mean to a deeply spiritual Christian
much more than it would to a shallow and
frivolous one?</p>

<p>I do not contend that all the Pharisees, or
any of them, were the equals of Jesus in
spiritual depth, just as I would not contend
that all Christians, or any of them, were his
equals in that respect. But there is certainly
no warrant for saying that all Pharisees understood
the common phrases of their religion in
a low and narrow sense, as compared with the
sense in which Jesus understood them. To
say that "Our Father in Heaven" meant for
the Pharisee only that God had chosen Israel
to be His own people, and that the name
Father "did not in the Jewish theology lead
to a deeper insight into the nature of God as
Love," is one of the flagrant misrepresentations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
with which Weber's book abounds (Weber,
p. 150). There may have been Pharisees
to whom the phrase meant nothing more;
there certainly were Pharisees to whom it
meant that God was near to each one of His
children, in love and mercy and personal care.
That the Pharisee thought of God only, or
even mainly, as distant and inaccessible, or as
a taskmaster whose service was hard, is a
baseless fiction. Even, then, allowing that
Jesus, by the depth and power of his own
spiritual nature, did read into the common
terms of Jewish religion a fuller meaning
than had been previously found there, he
nevertheless used those terms because they
served to carry that meaning, as they stood
and without alteration.</p>

<p>We have, then, reached this position, that
both Jesus and the Pharisees shared in
common a Judaism expressed in the terms of
a spiritual Theism, developed in the Synagogue
and the home, and learned there alike by the
Pharisees and by Jesus. It was certainly not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the creation of the Scribes, <i>quâ</i> Scribes, so that
Jesus, or anyone else, would need to have sat
at the feet of some Gamaliel in order to learn
it. It was the spiritual inheritance of the
Jew, into which he entered by natural piety,
and from which neither the simple and unlearned
nor the Scribe versed in the subtleties
of the Halachah was excluded. I shall have
more to say about this in the concluding
chapter.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the common ground which
Jesus shared with the Pharisees. We have
now to study the opposition between them,
which finally drove them apart in irreconcilable
antagonism. The true nature of that
opposition, the cause and ground of it, did
not appear at the outset. Indeed, it may be
questioned whether either the Pharisees or
even Jesus himself ever fully and consciously
realised the inner meaning of it. That the
Pharisees knew why they distrusted, feared,
and finally helped to destroy Jesus, is true
enough. And Jesus expressed, in the plainest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
terms, the ground on which he denounced the
Pharisees. But whether on either side the
real significance of the struggle was clearly
seen, is to my mind doubtful. Jesus may
have seen it. I do not think the Pharisees did,
or ever have done, from that day to this. To
bring out that meaning, or what seems to me
to be that meaning, will be the point to which
I shall lead up in the remainder of this chapter;
and with that in view I shall survey the
main incidents of the controversy as they are
recorded in the Gospels.</p>

<p>The appearance of Jesus as the successor of
John the Baptist, taking up his message and
proclaiming it with a force of his own, was
enough to draw immediate attention to Jesus,
and to incline men to give him a favourable
hearing. This is to put the matter from the
point of view of the people in general, and the
Pharisees in particular, who were in possession
of a settled religion, and to whom Jesus was
an unknown man who had to make his name.
That he preached repentance, and proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the near advent of the Kingdom of Heaven,
would be only a reason for listening to him.
No Pharisee, nor any other Jew, with the
national history behind him, would question
for a moment that God might at any time
raise up some messenger to proclaim His will.
What else had the prophets been, in the old
days? And had not John the Baptist been
much like one of them? That John, and
after him Jesus, had called his hearers to
repent, was no reason whatever for resenting
his boldness, or for denying his right to speak.
It was the natural thing for a prophet to do;
as, in much later times, it is natural for a
revivalist to convict his hearers of sin, and
lead them to the mercy seat. They do not
resent being called sinners, and are only grateful
for the glad tidings of the mercy which
saves them. So with the Pharisees; there
would be no disposition on their part to find
fault with Jesus for coming forward as a
preacher of repentance, let alone a herald of
the Kingdom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The point at which distrust of, and uneasiness
about, Jesus first entered the minds
of the Pharisees, is probably indicated by the
saying that "he taught as one having authority,
and not as their Scribes" (Matt. vii. 29).</p>

<p>To the conservatism which is commonly
found in the adherents of a religion long
established and settled in its ways, there was
added in the case of the Pharisees a special
veneration for the principle of traditional
authority. If at first they merely noticed that
Jesus was very independent, and wanting in
the deference which was due to the sages and
elders of his people, they could not fail before
long to discover that this was something more
than unconventional freedom of speech and
manner. If he had kept to his preaching of
repentance, and the announcement of the
Kingdom of Heaven, that might pass; but
he spoke of other things besides repentance,
and put forward views of his own as to what
the Kingdom implied. It would seem that
he was assuming the position of a teacher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
religion in general, since he touched upon
subjects which were not specially connected
with his mission. To the Pharisees he appeared
as a sort of unregistered practitioner,
if the comparison may be allowed. Much of
what he said they could not but agree with;
but how came he to say it? Some things
they did not agree with, and what right had
he to set up his own opinion against the
teaching commonly received and held? So
they began to ask, "Whence hath this man
this wisdom?" and "by what authority doest
thou these things?"<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Christians are accustomed, and rightly, to
regard it as one of the marks of the greatness
of Jesus that he did speak out of his own
mind and heart, as having his authority within
himself. But I am trying to put the case as
it presented itself to the Pharisees, looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it from their own very different point of view.
There was not amongst them any office exactly
corresponding to the position of a clergyman
or a minister. They were all laymen; and
if the priests had special functions, that was
only in connection with the ritual of the
Temple, and not with the giving of religious
instruction. After the Temple was destroyed,
the priest was only distinguished from the rest
by certain privileges of precedence, and certain
disabilities: he had no ministerial function as
leader of a congregation. Neither in the
time of Jesus nor after it were the Pharisees
a priest-ridden community.</p>

<p>Of far greater importance than the priest
was the Scribe: but the Scribe was only a
layman. He was not consecrated to a sacred
office, and to that extent set apart from the
rest of his fellow-men: he was indeed chosen
and appointed by those who were competent
to do so, but, in regard to what he might or
might not do, he was in just the same position
as any Pharisee who was not a Scribe. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
distinguished him from the rest of his brethren
was that he made it his special business to
study the Torah, both written and unwritten,
and to qualify himself to be a teacher of it.
His proficiency was recognised and vouched
for, by those who were already accepted religious
teachers, by some form of ordination.
To become a Scribe was not so much to take
orders as to take a degree, though that is not
an exact parallel.</p>

<p>I have explained in the preceding chapter
the way in which the Torah was regarded as
the embodiment of the full and final revelation
which God had made to Israel. It was the
source of all knowledge, the supreme authority,
the regulator of all action. It included within
its range the whole duty of man, his entire
relation to God and to his fellow-men. The
written Torah was contained in the Pentateuch.
The other canonical books of the Old Testament
were to be read in the light afforded by
the Torah, and to be valued for the help they
gave in illustrating its meaning, making clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
what had been left obscure in the Pentateuch.
That there could be any contradiction between
the secondary scriptures and the Pentateuch
was in theory impossible. And when in the
case of certain books, namely, Ezekiel, Ecclesiastes,
and the Song of Songs, contradictions
were alleged, the alternatives were to explain
away the contradiction or to reject the books
from the canon. The books were retained,
by an exercise of dialectic subtlety which is
graphically indicated in the statement that a
certain Rabbi burnt the "midnight oil" to the
extent of three hundred barrels, in his studies
to reconcile the book of Ezekiel with the
standard of the Torah (b. Shabb. 13<sup>b</sup>).</p>

<p>The unwritten Torah was the explication of
what was implicit in the written Torah, the
unfolding into fuller detail or greater clearness
of what was barely suggested in the Scripture.
Evidently, therefore, to know what was contained
in the Torah, <i>i.e.</i> what God had revealed,
it was needful to know the unwritten as well
as the written Torah, the former even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
perhaps than the latter. And this could only
be done by learning and remembering what
had already been taught and accepted as a
valid interpretation by previous teachers. A
Tradition of the Elders was a necessary result
of a religion of Torah. If a Pharisee were
offered some religious teaching or were invited
to do some action as a religious duty, he would
ask (supposing it was new to him), "Is this
Torah?" And he would not be satisfied until
he had been shown that it was. The proof
would be, either that it had already been taught
by such and such a recognised teacher, or that
the instructor, <i>being himself a recognised teacher</i>,
assured him that it was so. This was the
constant, and even necessary, form in which
instruction was given in the meaning of Torah.
And it should be carefully observed (a point
which is not usually understood) that this
method of Tradition by no means excluded
individual initiative or progressive development
of thought on the part of those who handed on
the Tradition. There was no finality in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Torah; the diligent and devout student of it
was always discovering something new, and if
he could show (as he usually could show) that
his new truth was in the Torah, that was an
addition to its known meaning, while yet the
Torah remained unaltered in the infinite richness
and fulness of its contents, the perfect
and divine revelation. I have shown that
progressive development was most marked
along the line of the Halachah. But there was
even more of free speculation, individual initiative
of research into spiritual things, though
there was less of methodical advance, along the
line of the Haggadah, as will be explained
more at length in the fifth chapter. But there
also the method, or rather the form, of Tradition
was the one mainly used, presumably as being
that which gave greatest security for the
validity of the results obtained. The Pharisees
in the time of Jesus, no less than the Rabbis
of the Talmud, were well able to think for
themselves, and in fact did so, upon religious
as upon other questions. And the reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they uniformly employed the method of
Tradition was not that they were hidebound
slaves of custom, but that their religion was
the religion of Torah. As the Torah was not
a burden, so the Tradition of the Elders was
not a constraint. Christians may, and usually
do, think that the burden and the restraint
must have been felt. But that is only because
the religion of Christians is not a religion of
Torah; and one who is accustomed to the
conditions and conceptions of the former, is
not likely to appreciate, and seldom tries to
understand, the conditions and conceptions of
the latter. Equally, of course, one who has
grown up in the habit of thought congenial to
the religion of Torah does not easily appreciate
and may seriously misunderstand the manifestations
of religion, in thought and speech,
where the Torah is not the controlling element.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Pharisees became
aware that Jesus was one who "taught as
having authority, and not as their Scribes,"
they were confronted with a fact which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were not in a position to understand, to the
meaning of which they had no clue, and which
could only appear to them as a contradiction
of their own principles. It would be extremely
perplexing to them to know what to make
of Jesus, and how to deal with him. What
he said seemed to be good; but was it Torah?
It might be; but how could they know that?
Some of it, of course, they were familiar with&mdash;the
common terms of the spiritual Judaism to
which reference has already been made. But
some things were new. Their own accepted
teachers, the Scribes, had not taught these
things, i.e. had not declared them to be Torah.
Jesus was not a Scribe. He did not say,
"This is Torah because I have learned it from
so-and-so." And, not being a Scribe, he was
not competent to declare it as from himself.
How could they receive his teaching, without
being unfaithful to what they already believed?
And if they were unfaithful to that? It
should be constantly remembered that the
religion of Torah meant to the Pharisee the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
whole of religion, all that was possible of
communion with God, and not merely of
obedience to precept. Within its characteristic
form there was room for all of that spiritual
Theism which, as has been shown, the Pharisees
had in common with Jesus. If he did not
hold that spiritual Theism under the form of
Torah, they did; and it was in its essence
much the same for both. They did not know
that the form of Torah, with its corollary of
Tradition, was not necessary to the retention
of the religion which brought them close to
God in love and obedience, in joy and trust.
And it seemed to them that they risked the
loss of all that, if they tampered with the
conception of Torah, or listened to one, however
persuasive and however eloquent, who
taught "not as their Scribes." If this was
the point of view from which the Pharisees
regarded Jesus, when they began to make
closer acquaintance with him, then it is easy
to understand how their feeling towards him
would be something much deeper than mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
petty jealousy or the prejudice of stupid
bigotry. No doubt there was some of that.
Inability to understand can express itself in
ways which are mean and contemptible, as is
seen in religious polemic in every age. The
Pharisees had no monopoly of ignorant spite.
But what I contend is that the attitude
of the Pharisees towards Jesus will bear a
much higher interpretation than mere arrogant
jealousy against an unauthorised intruder. It
was a repugnance towards teaching which
they could by no means bring within the frame
of their religion, and they could not imagine
any other frame for it; it was a shrinking fear
of a teacher who, with holy and good words
and deeds, seemed yet to be leading them
away from the only ideal they could recognise.
And leading not only them but also the
people, who were less able to guard against the
danger, and who, as they observed, "heard
him gladly," and even "hung on his words
listening." A religion so deeply wrought into
the souls of the best part of the nation as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
religion of Torah had been since the days of
Ezra, so strongly held, so passionately loved,
so marked in the individuality of its features,
could not enable those who clung to it to
unlearn the ways of their fathers, and to adapt
its contents to a new and unfamiliar form.
The religion of Torah, for all that it had much
in common with the religion of Jesus, could
never pass over into the form which he gave
to his religion. And although Christians may
say it was "blindness" on the part of the
Pharisees, they are not justified in saying that
it was also "hardness of heart," which made
them shrink from Jesus.</p>

<p>The occasions upon which they came into
conflict with him were probably numerous;
but the following may fairly be taken as
representative of the rest:&mdash;Healing on the
Sabbath; the question of divorce; the argument
about Corban. Along with the first
may be included the defence of his disciples
for plucking the ears of corn on the Sabbath.
And as a supplement to all may be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the long invective against the Pharisees in
Matt. xxiii. Whether this list follows the
chronological order I do not know, and for
the purpose in hand it does not matter. The
difference in principle is not affected by
questions of date.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have not included
the question of the Messiahship of Jesus. Of
course the Pharisees, like everybody else in
Israel at that time, speculated whether Jesus
was "he that should come," or whether they
were to "look for another." But they did not
directly challenge him on that point, as they
challenged him on the points I have already
named. Their challenge about the Messiahship
was indirect. Their position would be
that a man who set himself against the Torah
could not be the Messiah. Conceivably the
Messiah might in some respects supersede the
Torah, but he could never oppose it. And
when Jesus was driven to declare that in
certain points the Torah did not represent
divine truth, it was from that moment im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>possible
that the Pharisees should recognise
him as the Messiah, and inevitable that they
should regard him as a dangerous heretic.
This may explain why the Pharisees did not
ask him, in so many words, whether he was
the Messiah or not, and also did not offer
objections to any supposed claim to that position
made by him or on his behalf. The
question was only put to him directly by the
High Priest at the trial, and therefore not by
the Pharisees at all. And it is scarcely likely
to have been put then as a challenge to
argument; it was much more an attempt to
get evidence on which to convict him out of
his own mouth. Jesus was condemned and
executed on a more or less political charge, for
which the question of Messiahship provided a
useful basis; but he was really rejected, so far
at all events as the Pharisees were concerned,
because he undermined the authority of the
Torah, and endangered the religion founded
upon it.</p>

<p>That Jesus really did so is beyond dispute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
His final position was one which could not be
reconciled with recognition of Torah as the
Pharisees regarded it. But it may well have
been, and I think it was, the case that he was
only gradually driven to this position, and that
when he began his ministry he was not
conscious of any discrepancy between what he
was teaching and what the Torah implied.
That is presumably what he meant when he
said: "Think not that I came to destroy the
Torah and the prophets; I came not to
destroy but to fulfil" (Matt. v. 17). His
quarrel, at that time, was not with the Torah
itself, but with the Scribes and Pharisees, as
being unsatisfactory exponents of it. "For I
say unto you, That except your righteousness
shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes
and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter the
Kingdom of Heaven" (Matt. v. 17, 20).</p>

<p>There is here no opposition between the
conception of Torah and that of life under the
Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus also regarded
the Torah, at this time at all events, as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the supreme and final revelation that God had
given to Israel. To fulfil it was not merely to
obey its precepts but to make one's whole life,
in thought, word, and deed, respond to that
divine influence. And Jesus maintained that
the Pharisees did not go the right way to
attain that end. He himself came to fulfil
the Torah, by making that complete response
to its influence, and by showing how it could
and ought to be made. Any notion of getting
rid of it after having once and for all satisfied
its claims, belongs to a circle of ideas of which
it is safe to say that Jesus never dreamed.</p>

<p>But yet, if the explanation here offered
be correct, it is evident that what he still
supposed to be Torah, and the religion of
Torah, was not so in fact. He had grown up
with the conception of Torah, like any other
devout Jew; and he did not at once become
aware that what he conceived religion to be
was something that could not be expressed in
terms of Torah. The Pharisees perceived the
discrepancy sooner than he did; and while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
found another form for his religion, they adhered
to the old form because that was what
they knew, and they could not comprehend
anything different. To them, what he was
doing was not reconstruction or amplification
or exaltation of the old religion, but destruction
of it. And, so far as the conception of
Torah was concerned, they were quite right.
Torah and Jesus could not remain in harmony.
The two were fundamentally incompatible.
And the Pharisees, being determined to "abide
in the things they had learned," viz. Torah,
were necessarily turned into opponents of
Jesus.</p>

<p>This cleavage showed itself only gradually;
and what forced it on the consciousness, first
of the Pharisees and then of Jesus himself,
was shown in the several occasions of dispute,
where appeal had to be made to first principles.</p>

<p>I take first the case of the cure of a sick
man on the Sabbath, as it is recorded in
Mark iii. 1-6: "And he entered again into
the synagogue; and there was a man there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
which had his hand withered. And they
watched him, whether he would heal him
on the Sabbath day; that they might accuse
him. And he saith unto the man that had his
hand withered, Stand forth. And he saith
unto them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to
do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to
kill? But they held their peace. And when
he had looked round about on them with
anger, being grieved at the hardness of their
hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth
thine hand. And he stretched it forth, and his
hand was restored. And the Pharisees went
out, and straightway with the Herodians took
counsel against him, how they might destroy
him." It is evident that the narrator of
that story did not love the Pharisees, and it
would not be unreasonable to take a heavy
discount off it on the ground of prejudice.
But we may leave all that out of account.
Jesus challenged the Pharisees to say whether,
according to the Torah, he might or might
not cure the man on the Sabbath. If he got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
no answer, it was certainly not because they
had no answer to give. They would say,
"Why do on the Sabbath what could be done
on another day, if the doing of it would break
the Sabbath? The Torah says that the Sabbath
is to be kept holy; and this is done by
refraining from certain kinds of action, in
themselves perfectly right and proper. We
believe that the right way of fulfilling the
Torah&mdash;doing the will of God&mdash;is to do so-and-so.
And we believe that in order to save life,
when it is in danger, it is the will of God that
we should break the Sabbath, in any way that
may be necessary. But that we should not
break it for any less urgent cause. Here is
this man with a withered hand. He is in
no immediate danger. Certainly it is a good
thing to cure him. But why not have cured
him before? And if his cure should stand
over for a day, is that so great a harm to one
who has been some time in that condition that
the Sabbath must be made to give way to it?"
That is the sort of answer that the Pharisees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
would make. Of course, the rejoinder is ready
to hand, that to do good is right on any day,
Sabbath or no Sabbath. But that is not the
point. The challenge of Jesus was, "Is it
<i>lawful</i>?" <i>i.e.</i> "Is it in accordance with Torah?"
And the Pharisees were perfectly justified in
holding that it was not in accordance with
Torah. If Jesus interpreted Torah in a
different sense, that was his affair; and they
would not be the more disposed to agree with
him if it be true that he "looked round about
on them in anger." His action was in effect
an attack on Torah, whatever his intention
might be.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of Sabbath-breaking was
raised in another form in the incident described
in Mark ii. 23-28, and elsewhere. This is
chiefly of importance because it is made the
occasion for the declaration that "the Sabbath
was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
The action of the disciples in plucking the
ears of corn on the Sabbath was challenged by
the Pharisees. Jesus defended it by an appeal
to Scripture, the relevancy of which is not
obvious, and by the declaration just quoted,
which is only a valid defence if it means that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Sabbath can be put aside by man for his
own convenience, however slight the occasion.
The Pharisees would certainly agree to the
declaration about the Sabbath (it is found,
b. Joma 85<sup>b</sup>), but they would not admit the
interpretation which Jesus put upon it. They
would say that the Sabbath was a divine
institution, intended for the benefit of man;
and that, while for grave reason it might be
sometimes right to break the Sabbath, yet that
was not left to the caprice of anyone who
chose to break it. If that was allowed, the
blessing of the Sabbath would be gone and
the divine intention frustrated. From the
point of view of Torah, no other answer was
possible. And Jesus, in his treatment of the
Sabbath, by dispensing with the obligation of
the hitherto customary observance of it, was
disclosing the fact that he did not now look
at the matter from the point of view of Torah.</p>

<p>How far he was conscious of this divergence,
or rather, when he became aware of it, can
hardly be determined. But in the controversy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with regard to divorce the divergence became
unmistakable. The controversy was strictly
not about divorce in itself, but about the
attitude of the Torah towards divorce. Jesus
condemned divorce (Mark x. 2 fol.). Whether
he allowed the one exception or not, his
general condemnation of the practice is not
open to question. But the Pharisees also
condemned divorce. They could not abolish
it, but they sought to restrict what had been
the immemorial freedom of the husband to
put away his wife at his pleasure. It is often
urged against Hillel and Akiba that they
allowed divorce for frivolous reasons, and
Shammai is praised because he would not allow
divorce except for unfaithfulness. Neither
the blame nor the praise is justified or even
called for. The only difference between
Hillel and Shammai on the subject was
whether the Torah allowed divorce for trivial
reasons, or restricted it to the one grave
reason. It was a question of interpretation of
the authority recognised alike by Hillel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Shammai. It was not a question of the
private opinion of either of them upon the
ethical character of divorce. If Hillel and
Akiba had seen their way to interpret the
Torah in accordance with their own ethical
judgment, they would certainly have done so.
And, in fact, the Talmudic treatment of the
subject is in the direction of making divorce
difficult, and of giving protection, where
possible, to the wife against the caprice of the
husband. But in face of the fact that the
Torah, the written Torah, expressly allowed
divorce (Deut. xxiv. 1), not even Hillel and
Akiba could establish the contrary view.</p>

<p>So far as the condemnation of divorce on its
own account was concerned, the Pharisees
would be in agreement with Jesus, though
probably not to the extent of admitting no
exception, supposing that Jesus himself went
so far. The point of controversy was in regard
to the Torah as bearing on the subject. This
is clear, because Jesus himself appealed to the
Torah. He asked the Pharisees, "What did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Moses command you?" And it appears that
what he was thinking of was the passage,
Gen. i. 27, "Male and female created he
them." But the Pharisees quoted against
him the express command, Deut. xxiv. 1,
"Let him write a bill of divorce, etc." So
that here there was Torah against Torah.
The Pharisees would say, "We agree with
you that divorce ought, so far as possible, to
be restricted and avoided; but, nevertheless,
we cannot condemn it outright, because the
Torah, which is God's own teaching, expressly
allows and even enjoins it. But you, who do
condemn it outright, how do you reconcile
that with Torah?" Jesus answered that the
permission to divorce was a concession made
to human imperfection, and that the real
intention of God was expressed in the passage
in Gen. i. 27. But that answer implied
necessarily that the written Torah was, in this
one case at all events, not divine and perfect,
since it contradicted itself. And such an
answer was fatal to a recognition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
supremacy of Torah, as the Pharisees understood
it. To them, the fact that Jesus had,
in this one instance, definitely repudiated the
divine authority of Torah, would outweigh the
fact that upon the subject of divorce itself
they were to a large extent in agreement with
him. The result of the controversy would be
a deepened impression, alike on the Pharisees
and on Jesus, that his standpoint was not that
of Torah, and that his ground principle was
irreconcilable with theirs.</p>

<p>Another phase of the opposition between
Jesus and the Pharisees is shown by the incident
described in Mark vii. 1-23, of which
the catchword is "Corban." The Pharisees
and Scribes ask Jesus "why his disciples did
not follow the Tradition of the Elders, but ate
their bread with unwashed hands." Jesus
turned upon them and charged them with
making void the word of God by their Tradition.
"For Moses said, Honour thy father
and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil
of either father or mother, let him die the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
death. But ye say, If a man shall say to
his father or mother, That, wherewith thou
mightest have been profited by me, is Corban,
that is to say, Given to God, ye no longer
suffer him to do aught for his father or his
mother; making void the word of God by
your Tradition; and many such like things
ye do." Now, even if the charge brought
against the Pharisees were true, that they
would not allow a man to be released from a
vow in order to honour his parents, they
would not thereby be "making void the word
of God by their Tradition." On the contrary,
they would be upholding it. For, while
Exod. XX. 12 says, "Honour thy father and
thy mother," Num. xxx. 2 says, "When a man
voweth a vow unto the Lord, or sweareth
with an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he
shall not break his word, he shall do according
to all that proceedeth out of his mouth."
No provision is made for annulling vows,
except those of a wife by her husband or her
father under certain conditions. The practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of annulling vows generally was introduced
by the Rabbis, and they admitted that it had
no direct sanction in Scripture. If, therefore,
in the case of a man who had made a vow to
the detriment of his father and mother, they
refused to release him, they would be upholding
Scripture against their Tradition. True,
Scripture would be opposed to Scripture; but
the responsibility for that rested on Moses,
not on them; and the practice of annulling
vows would have the effect of removing that
contradiction, and was perhaps so intended.
However that may be, the charge against the
Pharisees of making void the word of God by
their Tradition would not be borne out in
this instance, even if it were true that they
refused to release a man from a vow of the
kind described.</p>

<p>But the assertion that they did so refuse is
contrary to the express statement of the
Mishnah, which is the codified Tradition; and
is moreover entirely at variance with the
spirit of Rabbinical ethics in regard to respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to parents. The crucial passage is M. Nedar.
ix. 1, and it runs thus: "R. Eliezer says,
'They open a way for a man on the ground
of honour to his father and mother.' The
Wise forbid. R. Zadok said, 'Before they
open a way for him on the ground of honour
to his father and mother, they should open it
for him on the ground of honour to God. If
this were so, there would be no vows.' The
Wise agree with R. Eliezer, that in a matter
which is between a man and his father and
mother they open a way for him on the
ground of honour to his father and mother."
Two cases are here distinguished; in the
first, if a man makes a vow of any kind, he
is not to be released from it on the ground
that it would bring reproach on his parents
to have such a rash and foolish son. He
must be made to keep his vow. But in the
second case, if a man make a vow upon a
matter between himself and his parents, i.e.
one which, if he keep it, will occasion injury
or loss to them, then he is to be released from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
it on the ground of honour to his parents.
The commentators on the Mishnah all agree
in this interpretation, and there is no doubt
as to the intention of the Mishnah. Moreover,
there is no indication that there ever
had been a different opinion, as if the statement
now made in the Mishnah had taken
the place of an earlier statement. There is
no evidence that the Pharisees ever held or
taught the doctrine attributed to them by
Jesus, while it is contradicted in the most
definite manner by the declarations of their
own legal authorities.</p>

<p>The charge is all the more pointless because
the Pharisees, whatever else they may have
failed in, always showed the most devoted respect
to parents. A more unfortunate ground
of attack could hardly have been chosen than
that which is taken in the Corban incident;
and the Pharisees would not have had the
slightest difficulty in repelling the charge
brought against them. Whether the error
involved in the account of the incident be due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to the Evangelist or to Jesus himself, an error
it remains. And it is not fair, on the strength
of the New Testament text, however it came
to be written, to hold the Pharisees guilty of
denying that which they themselves expressly
enjoin. That is the fact. How the misstatement<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
came to be made, I do not know
and will not speculate. Of course this does
not in any way affect the truth of the principle
enunciated by Jesus: "There is nothing from
without the man which going into him can
defile him, etc." That marks, in practical
effect, though possibly not in theory, a complete
breach with Pharisaism, since the Torah
did, in the most explicit manner, distinguish
between clean and unclean, and did teach
that outward things caused defilement. The
Pharisees held by the Torah; Jesus, at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
point, threw it over. Yet the Pharisees could
and did say that the defilement was not
caused by the outward thing itself, but expressed
the will of God that certain actions
and contacts should be avoided. Why He
had so willed, they did not know nor inquire;
enough that He had so willed, and included
it in the Torah which He had given. If it be
said, "So much the worse for a religion and
an ethic which are based on Torah," the
question is taken down to first principles, and
will be answered variously according to the
view held of those first principles. I only
observe that the religion of Torah was
hampered by the fact that it applied a sublime
theory to material some of which was
originally quite independent of that theory
and unworthy of it; and the Pharisees were
unable to recognise that fact, while doing
their best, and a very splendid best, to overcome
a difficulty of whose nature they were
not, and could not be, aware.</p>

<p>The opposition between Jesus and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Pharisees finds its most emphatic expression
in the long speech contained in Matt. xxiii.,
the keynote of which is: "Woe unto you,
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!" It is
sometimes argued that Jesus himself did not
say all the hard things in that speech, but that
they represent the hostility of the early Church
towards the men who had destroyed her
founder. That is possible; and certainly the
Evangelists do not incline to a favourable view
of the Pharisees on any occasion. But I do not
feel free to evade the duty of dealing with that
speech by availing myself of that argument.
Moreover, I do not see anything to make it
impossible, or even unlikely, that Jesus did
say all those things. Having in effect broken
with the religion of Torah, and being in the
position of a man driven to bay, fighting, as
the saying is, with his back against the wall, it
is only human nature that he should so speak
as to hit hard. And, if it were the case of any
other man, who would take the words spoken
under such conditions as expressing the calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and deliberate judgment of the speaker upon
the persons addressed, or as weighty evidence
of the truth of the statements made? I am
not going to go through the various charges
in order to estimate the truth or the exaggeration
of them. I shall make no suggestions
that perhaps the Pharisees in that time were
very bad, though they were more respectable
before, and, in a curious way, recovered their
character afterwards. Nor will I admit that
it was perhaps true of the rank and file, but
that men like Hillel and Gamaliel and
Jo&#7717;anan b. Zaccai were honourable exceptions.
If it was true at all, it was most of all
true of Hillel and Gamaliel and their compeers,
because these represented Pharisaism
in its perfection, and their religion was the
religion of Torah in all its height and depth
and length and breadth. Whatever could be
truly said of Pharisaism, either good or evil,
was true of the religion by which they lived.</p>

<p>I take all that sweeping denunciation as the
final expression of irreconcilable opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
between Jesus and the religion of Torah.
And I shall content myself with making a few
observations upon the fact and the meaning of
it. As for the term "hypocrites," the justice
of the implied charge is not established by the
fact that the charge is made. That hypocrisy
is possible under the religion of Torah is
undeniable; but there is certainly no necessary
connection between the two. The Pharisees
themselves were quite aware that there were
hypocrites in their ranks.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The retort would
be justified that hypocrites have been found
amongst professing Christians also. But recrimination
is not argument. The hypocrisy
question is not really difficult to understand,
if the explanation already given of the religion
of Torah be borne in mind. The theory of
that religion, when put into practice, necessarily
involved the doing of many acts in a
particular way. Even actions in themselves
of little or no importance became important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
when the Torah directed a specific way of
doing them. They were done as a fulfilment
of the will of God upon that particular point;
and His will was not fulfilled unless there was,
on the part of the agent, the conscious intention
of serving Him. The mere <i>opus operatum</i>
was worthless. To the Pharisee, starting from
Torah as his ground principle, the doing of a
multitude of apparently trifling acts was the
obvious way of putting religion into practice, and
he rejoiced in doing them. But one who did not
start from Torah as a ground principle would
have no clue to the understanding of what the
Pharisees did, or why they did it. If such a
one took as his ground principle the immediate
authority of conscience and his own direct
intuition of God, and if he then judged the
Pharisees by his standard and not by their
own, then he would easily draw the conclusion
that they were hypocrites, because he
would see them treating as of great importance
things which conscience would pay no attention
to; and he would judge that men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
could be satisfied to discharge the obligations
of religion in such a way, must either be
ignorant of what religion really is, or pretenders
to a piety they did not possess. The
religion of Torah lays itself open to the
misconstruction which charges its adherents
with hypocrisy. But, apart from particular
instances where the charge could be established,
the charge only shows how far those
who make it are unable to comprehend the
Pharisaic conception of religion. To urge
that their conception of religion was defective
is legitimate; to condemn them as hypocrites
on the strength of a different conception of
religion is not legitimate, no matter by whom
it is done.</p>

<p>And this leads me to the conclusion of what
I have to say about the opposition between
Jesus and the Pharisees. The conflict was
one between two fundamentally different conceptions
of religion, viz. that in which the
supreme authority was Torah, and that in
which the supreme authority was the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>mediate
intuition of God in the individual
soul and conscience. The Pharisees stood for
the one; Jesus stood for the other. The
particular occasions of dispute, some of which
have been noticed, mainly served to bring out
this fundamental opposition; at all events that
is their chief importance.</p>

<p>The conflict was unequal, because it was
one in which an Idea was matched against a
Person. The idea of Torah was sublime, and
deserved all the devoted loyalty that was given
to its expression and defence. But it was an
idea, mediated in the consciousness of those
who held it. Jesus was a living soul, with the
spiritual force of a tremendous personality;
and against him the idea of Torah could not
prevail. This was the real meaning of the
fact that he taught "as one having authority,
and not as their Scribes." This was the ground
of his claim to forgive sins, a claim which the
Pharisees could only interpret as blasphemy
(Mark ii. 7). And this appears in all his relations
with the Pharisees, as the force which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
opposed them, and which they could neither
comprehend nor overpower. They could not
at the same time retain the conception of
Torah as the basis of their religion and admit
the authority of Jesus. They saw no reason
why they should abandon Torah; they could
not therefore do other than reject Jesus.
And when the verdict of the Pharisees is
expressed in the saying of the Talmud, already
quoted, "Jesus practised magic and deceived
and led astray Israel," that contemptuous dismissal
shows how completely they failed to
realise that what had opposed them had been
the strength of a great personality. And I do
not think that on the Jewish side this ever
has been realised from that day to this. If
the Pharisees had realised it they would have
met him with arguments quite different from
those which they did use; possibly they would
have refrained from controversy altogether.
As it was, they remained within the circle of
religious ideas which they knew, and continued
to find in the Torah the satisfaction of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
spiritual wants&mdash;a real satisfaction of real
wants, such as men might feel who were not
hypocrites and impostors, but earnest and
devout, and chiefly concerned to do the will of
their Father in Heaven, in what they believed
to be the way He desired.</p>

<p>If there was on the part of the Pharisees a
complete inability to comprehend the religious
position of Jesus, there was also on his part an
inability<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to comprehend the religious position
of the Pharisees. If he had realised what
Torah meant to the Pharisees, he might, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
doubtless would, have desired to show them a
"more excellent way," but he would not have
taken the line which he did of denunciation
and invective, since to do so would defeat his
purpose.</p>

<p>This I believe to be the real truth about the
inability of both the Pharisees and Jesus to
understand each other, or, in other words, the
impossibility of harmony between the religion
of Torah and the religion of the individual
soul, if I may so describe it. That incompatibility
is fundamental. Christianity, in all its
forms, is a religion founded on personality,
one in which the central feature is a Person.
And Judaism, at all events since the days of
the Pharisees, is a religion in which the
central feature is not a person, at all events
not a human person, but the Torah. It is near
the truth to say that what Christ is to the
Christian, Torah is to the Jew. And alike to
Christian and to Jew it is almost impossible
to comprehend the religion of the other.
Even Jesus could not do it. And if he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
not do it, what wonder that his greatest
disciple, Paul, in passing from the one conception
of religion to the other, should have
failed to carry with him into his new faith the
remembrance of what the old faith had meant
to him while he lived in it?</p>

<p>To the further consideration of this essential
opposition between the religion of Torah and
the Christian religion I shall proceed in the
next chapter, when I shall deal with the
criticism of Torah in the Epistles of Paul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap">Pharisaism and Paul</span></h2>


<p>If Christians usually get their ideas about the
Pharisees from the Gospels, they learn their
general conception of Judaism from the
Epistles of Paul. And, when they find that
the Judaism which he condemns is in fact
the Judaism of the Pharisees, they combine
their information, and rest content with the
conclusion that alike in theory and practice
the Pharisees were as far as they well could
be from the Kingdom of Heaven. A verdict
which claims the authority of both Jesus and
Paul would seem, to Christians at least, to
leave nothing more to be said, and to admit
of no appeal. And in fact it has prevailed,
and still prevails, in spite of all the efforts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the Jews to obtain even a hearing on the
other side.</p>

<p>As, in the preceding chapter, I examined
the relation of the Pharisees to Jesus, and
tried to explain how it was that they came to
stand to each other in such sharp antagonism,
so in the present chapter I shall try to explain
how it was that Paul came to represent the
Pharisaic conception of religion in the way he
did, and what grounds there are for saying
that his representation does not correspond
with the facts. Pharisaic Judaism is, or can
be, perfectly well known; for it is written
large in the Rabbinical literature, by men who
were remarkably honest in setting down their
faults as well as their virtues. It is there for
anyone to study; and no one is entitled to
say that the description of it given by Paul,
or by anybody else, is accurate or not, until
he has studied the thing itself. The fact that
it can only be studied in books which are
written in Hebrew and Aramaic (except so
far as translated) does not exempt the student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
from the duty of reading them, if he really
means to learn what is true in the matter.
If he does not, then what is his opinion worth?</p>

<p>The Christian will probably say in reply:
"Did not Paul himself know all about it?
Was he not born and bred a Jew? Was he
not a 'Pharisee of the Pharisees'? Had he not
been 'zealous beyond those of his own age in
the Jews' religion'? Was he not 'as touching
the law blameless'? Who could be a better
and more reliable witness upon the question
what the Jews' religion really was?" Yes.
And did Paul not abandon the Jews' religion?
Did he not write about it long years after he
had been converted to a different religion?
And is it not common knowledge that a
convert seldom takes the same view of the
religion he has left as is taken by those who
remain in it? If Paul, while he was still a
Pharisee, had written down his thoughts upon
the worth and meaning of Pharisaism, that
would be valuable evidence indeed; and it
would be interesting to trace the process by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
which he then made his way to another form
of religion. As it is, what he says about
Judaism is no evidence of what he felt it to
be while he was in it, or of what those felt
it to be who remained in it. And if, as is the
unquestionable fact, his representation of it
differs very widely from theirs, then we are
not entitled to draw the conclusion that
his presentation is correct, whatever the
other may have been (a point on which
few trouble to inquire). We have rather to
account, if we can, for the very peculiar form
which his presentation of Pharisaism took. I
might, indeed, have left Paul out altogether
from this book; because, in strict truth, there
is nothing to be learned directly from him
upon the question what Pharisaism really was.
But, indirectly, there is a great deal to be
learned; because, whether his conception of
Pharisaism be correct or not, it serves to show
how it appeared to a very exceptional man,
looking at it from a point of view which was
no longer Jewish. And to understand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
estimate the changed appearance due to that
alteration of the point of view, is to get to the
heart of the difference between Judaism and
Christianity.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this inquiry I shall take
the Epistles bearing the name of Paul, at all
events the four great ones, as being really his.
I have not yet been able to persuade myself
that any collections of fragments, pieced together
and interpolated, could be so combined
as to give the impression of a single great
personality behind them. Paul may not have
been either always consistent or always logical;
but how anyone can read those letters, with
their eager hurry of argument, their passionate
outpouring of devout feeling, and still think that
they are the composite patchwork of second-century
nobodies, is to me a mystery. I shall
therefore assume that what is written in those
Epistles is what Paul wrote; that what he
says about himself is true; and that what he
says about Judaism, or anything else, is what
he believed to be true when he wrote it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of what he wrote, at all events
about Judaism, has been to inflict what Jews
feel to be a cruel injustice on their religion.
To Paul himself, I imagine, it can only have
appeared to be the obvious and necessary
statement of the result of his changed position
in religion. He has left it on record that,
through his conversion, he became a new man
in Christ (2 Cor. v. 17). And one of the
implications of that fact is that he should no
longer be able accurately to reproduce in his
mind what the "old man" had felt and
thought and believed; he would retain only
the distant memory of discarded things. If
he wrote of the religion he had left, it would
be, not of what once had been his, but of
what he could only judge as an external thing,
variously defective when seen in the light of
his present religion.</p>

<p>Beyond the fact, then, that by his own
account Paul had been before his conversion
a zealous and consistent Pharisee, we do not
know what his earlier opinion had been upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
any subject whatever. He does not become
known to us until after his conversion; and
the writings from which we gain the knowledge
of him were not composed till twenty
years or more had elapsed since that event.
Of his conversion he says very little; not
enough to enable us to understand precisely
what took place. It may well be, indeed, that
he himself could never have stated in words, at
any time, precisely what took place, or what,
if anything, led up to the change. This much,
however, is beyond question, that as a result
of his conversion Christ became to him the
central element in his religion. All his
spiritual life depended on Christ. All his
thought was conditioned by his idea of Christ.
All the energy of soul which was his to give
for the fulfilling of his ministry he ascribed
to the immediate personal influence of Christ
upon him. Christ was the all and everything
of his religious life; and the lines upon
which his subsequent career was laid out, so
that he became the Apostle of the Gentiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
were marked out by his conception of the
relation in which he believed himself to stand
towards Christ. In some marvellous way, it
seemed that Christ had entered and taken
possession of him; with the result that he
became the Paul whom we know.</p>

<p>There must have followed a process, whether
short or long, by which he adjusted himself
to his altered mental position, estimated the
effect of the change upon his previous beliefs
and ideas, and grasped the meaning of new
and unfamiliar ones. For it goes without
saying that his conversion widened the scope
of his thought so as to bring many things
within the range of his inward vision that
previously had been unnoticed or not understood,
as it also changed his estimate of what
had been previously there. But of the details
and the order of that process we know nothing.
We cannot tell, for instance, whether it began
with the settling of his attitude towards
Judaism, or whether he was drawn first
towards the idea of salvation for the Gentiles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
We only know the results long after the
process was completed, when he had shaped in
thought a more or less consistent theory of
divine providence, as shown in the history of
the world.</p>

<p>The opening chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans shows how profoundly he was impressed
by the moral chaos of the Gentile
world; but the fact is mentioned there only to
give the explanation of it. For an explanation
was needed. Such a state of humanity was in
terrible contrast to the perfection which should
have been found in those whom the all-holy
God had made. Doubtless there were differences
of better and worse between this man
and that; but, judged by the standard of perfection,
<i>i.e.</i> of complete harmony with God,
all were alike immeasurably below what they
ought to be. Not only the Gentiles, but the
Jews also, came under this condemnation.
Jews indeed were not guilty of the loathsome
vices which made the Gentile life so horrible;
but it was clear that, in regard to the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of perfection which God desired in man, the
Jews wholly failed to reach it. All the world
over, through all the multitude of human
beings, "there was none righteous, no not one"
(Rom. iii. 10).</p>

<p>Yet the Gentiles, Paul argued, could have
known, and even did know, something of
God; but they disowned that knowledge, and
"glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks;
but became vain in their reasonings, and their
senseless heart was darkened.... Wherefore
God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts ... for
that they exchanged the truth of
God for a lie, and worshipped and served the
creature rather than the Creator" (Rom. i.
21, 24-5).</p>

<p>And the Jews knew well the will of God,
for to them He had revealed it through Moses
and the prophets; with them He had made
His covenant, and had chosen them out of all
the nations of the earth, to be a peculiar people
unto Himself. How was it that they too fell
so far short of what was required of them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Must it not have been (so Paul reasoned)
because the divine Law<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that was given them
was the very means and occasion of sin?
To fail in regard to one single precept was
to break the harmony between man and God;
and, when once that harmony was broken,
there was nothing in the Law itself to restore
it. By its multiplication of commandments,
the Law offered so many occasions for the
breaking of that harmony; and whereas it was
"holy, and the commandment righteous and
just and good," its ideal was one that no human
effort could reach. Its effect was to multiply
sin. Righteousness under the Law was impossible;
meaning by righteousness the state
of perfect harmony of man with God.</p>

<p>"But now," says Paul (Rom. iii. 21 fol.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
"apart from the law a righteousness of God
hath been manifested, being witnessed by the
law and the prophets; even the righteousness
of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all
them that believe; for there is no distinction;
for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of
God; being justified freely by his grace through
the redemption that is in Jesus Christ," etc.</p>

<p>Through faith in Jesus Christ there was
offered to sinful man the means of attaining
that righteousness&mdash;harmony with God&mdash;which
had been vainly sought under the Law,
or lost in the darkness of Gentile corruption.
And this was evidently what God had willed
from the beginning. Christ was the instrument,
or the agent, by whom this divine
purpose was to be fulfilled. And the meaning
of what might seem to be the age-long delay
of his coming was that God would "shut up all
under sin, that he might have mercy upon all."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ performed his divinely appointed
mission by his death on the Cross, and his
subsequent resurrection; having borne and
discharged the obligation of the unfulfilled
Law, and thereby released all, whether Jews or
Gentiles, from the bondage of sin. Righteousness
was now attainable through faith in
Christ; and I presume that Paul meant by
righteousness, harmony with God, resulting
from such an attitude on the part of the
believer towards Christ as that in which Paul
himself stood towards him, in other words, a
complete surrender of heart and will to Christ,
so as to "put off the old man" and become
"a new creature." Those who did this would
thereby attain to perfect harmony with God,
which is righteousness.</p>

<p>I do not stop to dwell upon the way in
which Paul explained the fact that the offer of
salvation was not universally accepted. For
I do not forget that my task is not to expound
the whole of Paul's theology, but to explain
his view of Pharisaism. I leave out, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
all mention of election and reprobation, in
order to come to the question how the Jews
were dealt with in Paul's theory. For here
he was confronted with the fact that the Jews
had rejected Christ, and not only rejected him
but killed him. In the most emphatic manner
they had refused the means of grace which
had been offered to them through him. They
had, to that extent, frustrated the purpose of
God in sending him. They, in common with
the Gentiles, had been, as stated already, shut
up under sin that God might have mercy on
them. And they had spurned that mercy.
How was that to be explained? "Did
God then cast off his people?" Paul asked
(Rom. xi. 1). Not so. "But a hardening in
part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of
the Gentiles be come in" (Rom. xi. 25). All
that God had willed towards Israel, and
declared in the ancient Scriptures, still held
good; but its fulfilment was delayed by the
disobedience of Israel; and that disobedience
was made to serve the purpose of God, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
by its means salvation should come to the
Gentiles. The full development of this thought
will be found in chapters ix. to xi. of the
Epistle to the Romans, and need not be given
here. It was Paul's way of getting over a
formidable difficulty, namely, the obvious fact
that the attitude of the Jews towards Christ
was not at all what was to be expected, if his
theory of the person and work of Christ were
true. It must not be forgotten that the
starting point of his theory was his own
personal relation to Christ, as he felt it with an
intense certainty which nothing could shake
for a moment. That was his foundation of
absolute truth; and that could not but be the
clue by which he interpreted all that he beheld
in the world, and read in the history of man.
With his application of this clue to the case of
the Gentiles I am not now concerned. But,
in applying it to the case of the Jews, he was
reasoning from premises which were not, and
never have been, accepted by Jews. He represented
the relation of man to God in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
faith in, and communion through, Christ; so
that, previous to the coming of Christ, both
revelation and communion had been partial and
defective. The Jews represented the relation
of man to God in terms of Torah, in the knowledge
of divine truth therein contained, and in
filial obedience to God whose precepts were
recorded in it. They found, on the lines of
Torah, the ground of faith in God and present
communion with Him; and while they always
hoped to learn more of the contents of revelation&mdash;to
be shown "wonderful things out of the
Torah,"&mdash;and while they aspired to a closer walk
with God, they never felt that the Torah needed
to be replaced by any other means of revelation
and communion, as being itself only partial
and defective. To say of the Torah, as Paul
said, that it was a means by which God had
prepared the way for Christ, implied that it
had only a secondary value on its own account.
Indeed, it was rather harmful than helpful, if
the effect of its working was to "cause the
trespass to abound," and that effect was in no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
way justified by the alleged intention, on the
part of God, that "grace might abound more
exceedingly." A Christian, brought up on
Paul, may see no difficulty in believing that
the holy and righteous God could or would act
in such a way. But to a Jew, brought up on
Torah, it was impossible so to believe, and he
would repudiate the suggestion with indignation;
partly by reason of his reverence for
God, and partly by reason of his own experience
of Torah, and of spiritual life under
it. Paul's theory might be valid for himself,
but it was not valid for the Jew; and, arguing
from his premises, he only described an unreal
Judaism, such as it doubtless ought to have
been if his premises had been true, but such as,
in fact and experience, it certainly was not.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Paul, of course, was expounding Christianity;
and he had no concern with Judaism, except
to account to Christian readers for the very
obvious difficulties which it placed in the way
of his theory. His explanation of the meaning
of Judaism is not a study of that form of religion
on its own account, but the theoretical
completion of his view of the work of Christ.
If Christ came when he did, and if he fulfilled
such and such a function in the drama of
Providence, then the Judaism that was before
him must have meant so and so, and must
have been intended by God to produce such
and such results. That seems to me to have
been the real line of Paul's argument. And,
as it started from his intense personal conviction
of the inward presence of Christ, it is not
wonderful that he should fail to see that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
facts of Judaism did not at all correspond to
his theory; or that he should assign to the
Torah a function which, if put in practice,
would have been fatal to the existence of
Judaism long before Christ came. Paul
argued on the religion of Torah from the
postulates of the religion of Christ. But
Torah and Christ are incommensurable terms;
and Paul's presentation of Pharisaic Judaism
is, in consequence, at its best a distortion, at
its worst a fiction.</p>

<p>I shall presently offer reasons in support of
that judgment, which is not a hasty assertion
but a deliberate opinion formed after years of
comparing the Judaism of the Rabbis with
Paul's version of it. Before, however, going
on to this further part of my task, I will pause
for a moment to consider the difference between
Paul's attitude and that of Jesus towards the
Pharisees and their religion. In the main it
is this&mdash;that Paul condemned Pharisaism in
theory, while Jesus condemned it in practice.
Paul held that the whole system was radically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
defective, and remained so whatever relative
excellence might be produced under it in the
lives and characters of those who submitted
to it. He condemned it, though he had himself,
as he said, been "as touching the Torah,
blameless." Jesus, on the other hand, charged
the Pharisees with certain specific sins and
vices, such as hypocrisy, pride, self-righteousness,
etc. And he did not expressly denounce
the systematic religion of Torah as such,
although, as has been shown in the preceding
chapter, he did on certain points reject the
Torah. The Pharisees themselves were quite
aware that the faults he denounced were not
unknown amongst them. The Talmud bears
honest witness to that fact, in the passage so
often quoted (b. Sotah, 22<sup>b</sup>), about the seven
kinds of Pharisees.</p>

<p>The censure of Jesus admits of the possibility
that some, at least, of the Pharisees
were pious and good. And that Scribe, to
whom Jesus said, "Thou art not far from the
kingdom of God" (Mark xii. 34), did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
cease to be a Pharisee by reason of the opinion
he had expressed.</p>

<p>But Paul's condemnation of Pharisaism
would include, not only that Scribe, but all
of his nation in whom goodness and piety
might be thought to have shown. And not
only so, but these were by so much the more
to be condemned in that they gave fullest expression
to the principle of Torah. If the
system was wrong, evidently those who most
completely and consistently acted up to it
were most deeply tainted with its error.
Paul's universal negative challenges the contradiction
of all the saints, martyrs, and heroes
of Israel.</p>

<p>I go on now to support the statement made
above that Paul's presentation of Judaism is at
its best a distortion and at its worst a fiction;
that, however regarded, it does not correspond
with the facts. I shall have to show that the
Torah was not such as Paul represented it to
be, and that it did not have the effect which
he ascribed to it, in the religious experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of those who lived under it. Also, that the
Pharisee living under the Torah was not
thereby debarred from such communion with
God as Paul claimed for the believer in
Christ; that, indeed, Pharisaism had nothing
to learn in this respect from Christianity, at
all events Paul's Christianity. What he
offered to the Pharisees was either what they
had already in a form which they preferred, or
what they had not got and did not want.
Upon these points I will proceed to enlarge
during the remainder of this chapter.</p>

<p>That the Torah was not such as Paul represented
it to be is a statement which is true,
both positively and negatively. He ascribed
to it a character which it did not possess, and
he left out of his description features which it
did possess, and which were essential to it.
Paul always takes Torah in the sense of
"precept," "mitzvah," &#957;&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#962; [Greek: nómos], not necessarily
separate injunctions, but a collective expression
of command, for which the term Law is
appropriate. The divine will imposed this on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Israel as the moral ideal, and, in demanding
obedience to it, set up a goal that could never
be reached.</p>

<p>The more the divineness and holiness of
the Law was recognised, the greater must
be the sin of disobeying it, the deeper the
despair resulting from such disobedience.
Righteousness, the harmony of the human will
with the divine, was only possible by fulfilling
the whole Law; to fail in a single point was to
break that harmony, and thus to become unrighteous.
The Law, with its multitude of
precepts, only served to increase the occasions
of sin, and plunge the sinner in a deeper
despair. This is, in brief, Paul's view of the
Law.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>It is safe to say that no Jew before Paul
ever thought of the Torah in that way, or
ever felt the despair which, according to this
theory, he should have felt. Certainly, or let
me say probably, no Pharisee ever completely
fulfilled all the "mitzv&#333;th" of the Torah; but
I have never come across any Pharisee who
was overwhelmed with despair on that
account. And, if it be said that this only
shows the blindness and conceit of the
Pharisees, the answer is that even admitting
that (which I do not admit), still the Torah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
did not in fact present itself to the mind of
the Pharisee in the severe and threatening
form which it wears in Paul's description of
it. As, indeed, how should it?</p>

<p>It has already been shown, in the second
chapter, that the meaning of Torah, as the
Pharisee conceived it, was nothing less than the
full revelation which God had made to Israel,
partly by way of precept, partly by way of
more general instruction in divine things. So
far as the Torah was expressed in the form
of precept, it offered so many occasions for
serving God. Every "mitzvah" was an
opportunity for doing some part of the divine
will; and it was because God loved Israel
that he had given these opportunities, whereby
might be felt the joy of faithful service.
The Pharisee laid the whole emphasis on
doing as much as he could in that service;
whereas, according to Paul, he ought to have
laid the whole emphasis upon his own inability
to do <i>all</i> that was required. He ought to
have been burdened by guilt, and haunted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the despair of ever making his peace with the
God whose commands he had failed to obey.
Instead, he was full of joy that God had given
him something that he could do for His sake,
eager to do as much as he could; and though
he failed or sinned, from time to time, he was
"not utterly cast down," because he trusted
that if he heartily repented God would forgive
him, and take him back. The Torah was not
a burden to the Pharisee, either by reason of
the number or the difficulty of its precepts,
or by the thought of the impossibility of
completely satisfying its demands. And if
there were ever a Pharisee in such a state of
despair that he should cry, "O miserable man
that I am! who shall deliver me from the
body of this death?" he would think of the
Torah not as the cause of his anguish, but as
the hope of his deliverance. And it was the
Torah itself which kept him from ever falling
into such despair; for it was God's own word
of help and guidance, the record of His endless
mercy, the revelation of His love. Paul would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
never have ascribed to the Torah such power
to cause despair, unless he had ceased to feel
towards it as a Pharisee would feel; and he
ceased to feel so, because, in his mind, the
place once filled by Torah was now filled by
Christ. For him there remained of Torah
only the shrivelled and misshapen corpse,
instead of the once glorious and living form.
The one is held up to reproach in the Epistles
of Paul; the other is the object of endless
praise, of reverent wonder, almost adoring
rapture, in the literature of the Pharisees.</p>

<p>But Paul's view of Torah is not completely
described by saying that he ascribed to it a
character which it did not possess and an
influence which it did not exercise. He leaves
out of account features which it did possess,
and represents the religion founded upon it
as lacking in elements which in fact were no
less present there than in his own religion.
As already shown, Paul represents Torah
exclusively as precept, &#957;&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#962; [Greek: nómos], whereas it comprised
the whole revelation recorded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Scripture and rendered explicit by the valid
interpretation of Scripture. It comprised,
therefore, the knowledge of God Himself, of
His providence and righteousness and fatherly
love, also, of the way of communion with
Him, the assurance of forgiveness to the
penitent, "the means of grace and the hope
of glory." All that belonged to his religion,
the Pharisee found indicated in the Torah,
somewhere; and it was his delight to learn
what God taught him therein.</p>

<p>Now Paul's whole case rests upon the fact
that there is no power in a commandment to
help a man to fulfil it. The Law was, according
to him, laid upon Israel with a demand
for obedience, but with no power to ensure
that obedience. The Law said, "Thou shalt";
but it gave no strength to the feeble will,
however much it might shine with pitiless
light upon the frightened conscience. Austere
messenger of the will of God, it stood over
its helpless slave, pointing indeed to heaven,
but stretching forth no hand to lead him there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
The Law being thus powerless to aid in the
fulfilment of the divine command, there could
be no righteousness under the Law, no harmony
between the human will and the divine. Even
if there ever had been such harmony, (and
there had not been since the sin of Adam),
there was no power in the Law to restore that
harmony when it had once been broken.
What the Law could not do, it was, according
to Paul, reserved for Christ to do. Through
faith in him came the power, not indeed to do
what the sinner had failed to do, but to restore
the broken harmony and reconcile man to
God. That power was the direct influence of
the living mind of Christ upon the human
soul; and the effect of it was to set it free
from bondage, so that it could of its own will
turn to God. Paul here states, in terms of
Christ, a profound truth, namely, that the
human soul depends, for its power to will and
desire the good, upon God; and that, without
the means of communion with its divine
source, the soul must languish and die. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Paul expounded this truth in terms of Christ,
because in his own experience it was through
Christ that the divine help had come to him;
the force of a living personality which had set
free his soul was that of Christ. To him it
seemed that such was the only way by which
the longed-for deliverance could be effected.
Now the Law was not a person, a living spirit,
but a command, a written word. And even
the Torah, in its wider meaning, was still only
a body of knowledge, a revelation, a complex
idea; it was not a living spirit, that could give
of its own life to a human soul. How, then,
could there be, under the conditions of Torah,
that imparting and receiving of divine influence
by which alone the soul could be
enabled to will the good, or even to live at
all? Such seems to me to be the reasoning
underlying Paul's conception of the powerlessness
of the Law to save, its failure to
impart righteousness.</p>

<p>But the Pharisee to whom that argument
might be addressed would not have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
slightest difficulty in meeting it. He would
say, "Certainly there must be that divine influence
upon the soul, the power imparted by
one living spirit to another; else the soul cannot
live or do any good thing. Certainly, also,
the Torah is not a living spirit; it is only a
body of truth, a revelation, a complex idea, or,
if you will, a set of commands. But, what
then? We look for help not to the commandment,
but to Him who gave the commandment;
not to the Law, but to the Lawgiver; not to
the Torah, but to the wise, holy, and loving
God, of whom the Torah is the revelation.
We learn, from the teaching which He has
given to us, to go direct to Him, pray to Him,
trust Him, love Him, find help and strength
from Him. He is our Father in heaven,
always ready to hear His children, to forgive
them when they repent of their sins against
Him, and to deliver them from evil."</p>

<p>This is what any Pharisee would reply to
Paul's argument about the impotence of the
Law to justify. The difference between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Pharisee and Paul upon this point is, in appearance,
very great; but, in fact, is very small.
Both are agreed that there must be the imparting
of divine influence to the human soul.
<i>With</i> that influence, the quickening of the
life of the soul by the divine power and inward
presence, the soul is enabled to will the good
and to love God. <i>Without</i> that influence it
would perish. The Pharisee held that the
divine influence was imparted direct from God
to the soul, without any intermediary. It
was not the Torah that imparted it, but God
Himself. The Torah was given to teach him;
having no power or life in itself, it revealed to
him the divine source of power and life, and
to that source he went.</p>

<p>Paul held that the divine influence was
imparted to the soul through Christ; and his
point, that it could not come through the Law,
is true, but wholly irrelevant; for no one ever
said that it could. The implication that it
could come <i>only</i> through Christ may be
relevant, but is certainly not true; for all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
experience of Jewish piety is witness against
it. When Paul, on the basis of his own experience,
set up his doctrine of the function
of Christ, in the relations between God and
man, he did what he had every right to do;
and he has earned the gratitude of all who
have found salvation through the faith in
Christ which they have learned from him.
But Paul was not entitled to ignore the experience
(no less genuine than his own) of
those whose conception of religion he condemned.
If all that they deemed essential to
religion, not merely the idea of Torah, but the
direct influence of the living God, had been
included and stated in Paul's presentation of
Judaism, then the comparison between the
Jewish and the Christian conception of religion
would have been more fair and equal; and if
it did not appear that there was any marked
superiority of the one over the other, there
would at least have been the evidence that
God is sought and found in more ways than
one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Enough, perhaps, has been said by way of
general argument to show that Paul's version
of Judaism is incorrect and defective. But it
will be well, at this point, to indicate more
particularly the evidence upon which I have
maintained that Pharisaism is not the barren
formalism that it is usually supposed to have
been, nor the merely preparatory foil to Christianity,
which is all that Paul could see in it.</p>

<p>There is first of all the general fact of the
existence of the Jewish people in unswerving
loyalty to the Torah, and in the faith and
practice of the religion founded upon it&mdash;an
existence and a loyalty maintained through
centuries of bitter persecution at the hands of
Christians. It is simply impossible that such
a result could have been produced, if the
religion, by which its adherents lived and for
which they died, had been a soulless hypocrisy,
a pious sham, or a futile delusion. If such
could have been the case, then what better
guarantee is there for the truth and worth
of the faith for which Christian saints and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
martyrs have died and heroes fought? A
corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.
And if the fruit be good, then, in the one case
as in the other, the tree must be good. No
adverse opinion of the Judaism which has
suffered and survived, and which, be it remembered,
is the Judaism of the Pharisees,
can be justified in face of the witness of Israel
to the faith once delivered to <i>its</i> saints.</p>

<p>There is further to be considered the fact
that before the time of Paul, and indeed ever
since, the Pharisees had for their spiritual
nourishment the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
including the prophecies and the Psalms.
The study of these, and the constant use of
them in the Synagogue, would have been
uncongenial to men whose one concern was
for hair-splitting casuistry, and would either
have been discontinued or reduced to an unintelligent
formality. It was neither. The
Scriptures were the constant study of the
Pharisee; and the worship of the Synagogue
derived much of its power to minister to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
needs of the worshippers, through its close
dependence on the devotional outpourings of
the Psalms, and the prayers which embodied
the spirit of them. The Pharisee never for a
moment thought that he was growing aloof
from the Prophets and Psalmists of the older
time; and while in the Torah, written and
unwritten, he believed he had a fuller and
more detailed knowledge of what God had
revealed, it was still the revelation of the
same God who had spoken to Abraham, who
had shown His power by the Red Sea and
on Sinai, who had inspired the Prophets and
been praised in the Psalms. There may be
legitimate regret that Israel cut itself off
from all knowledge of and contact with the
great literatures of Greece and Rome, and so
missed the salutary influence of variety of
thought. The Pharisees chose their own line
deliberately in this matter; and when they
saw what came of Hellenism, they might
well feel that they had chosen rightly. But
whether or not, if they did keep out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
great Gentile literature&mdash;the "external books,"
as they called them,&mdash;they most certainly did
"read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest" their
own. And a religion that has absorbed into
itself the ideas of the Hebrew Scriptures, a
religion whose springs have been continually
fed from that source, and whose ruling purpose
was to serve and glorify the God revealed
in those Scriptures, cannot have been, and
assuredly was not, the hard and narrow
formalism which its opponents have declared
it to be.</p>

<p>These considerations have weight as evidence
of what Pharisaism really was; and
their weight has by no means been sufficiently
taken into account; indeed, it has been
ignored altogether in the commonly accepted
estimates of the character of Pharisaism.
Strong, however, as such general evidence
is, I will further strengthen it by reference
to the utterances of Pharisees themselves,
taken from their own literature. And, out
of many that I might choose, I will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
such as bear more particularly upon the points
raised in the strictures of Paul.</p>

<p>First, I will take the Pharisaic doctrine<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of
repentance and restoration, because it is on
this that the antagonism of Paul is most pronounced,
and the injury done by his method
of treatment most serious. There is not in
the Rabbinical literature a strict and clearly
defined theological doctrine of repentance and
restoration; but there is a general belief that
the way of repentance is always open, by
which a sinner may come back to God, and
that God will forgive that sinner simply
because he has repented. I will illustrate
this by a few quotations from Rabbinical,
that is, Pharisaical works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Pesikta de R. Cahana</i> (p. 165ª ed.
Buber) the following occurs:&mdash;"The Holy
One, blessed be He, said to Jeremiah (the
prophet), 'Go and say to Israel, Repent.' He
went and said to Israel ('Repent'). They
said to him, 'Master, how can we repent?
With what face can we come before God?
Have we not angered him? Have we not
provoked him? Those mountains and hills
upon which we have worshipped false gods,
are they not still standing?' Jeremiah came
before the Holy One, blessed be He, and told
Him. He answered, 'Go and say to them,
If ye come to me, is it not to your Father
in Heaven that ye come? For I have been
a father unto Israel, and Ephraim is my
firstborn.'"</p>

<p>Again, in the same work (p. 163<sup>b</sup>) R. Eleazar
says: "It is the custom in the world that a
man will insult his neighbour publicly, and
afterwards seek to be reconciled to him. The
other will say to him, 'Thou didst insult me
publicly, and wouldst be reconciled between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
me and thee (<i>i.e.</i> privately). Go and bring
those in whose presence thou didst insult me,
and I will be reconciled to thee.' But the
Holy One, blessed be He, doeth not so; but
though a man stand and revile and blaspheme
him in the open street, the Holy One says to
him, 'Repent between thee and me, and I
will receive thee.'"</p>

<p>A story is told (b. A. Zar. 17ª) of a man
who was a particularly gross sinner, and who
in the midst of his sins was struck with terror
and remorse when it was said to him "Eleazar
b. Dordaia will not be received in repentance."
His frantic efforts to persuade some intercessor
to plead for mercy on him are described in a
passage too long to quote; but I translate the
conclusion, which runs thus:&mdash;"Then he said,
The matter hangeth only upon me (<i>i.e.</i> I must
seek mercy for myself). He laid his head
between his knees and groaned with weeping,
until his soul departed from him; and there
came a voice from heaven saying, 'R. Eleazar
b. Dordaia is summoned to the life of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
world to come.'" The purpose of that story
is simply to teach that even the vilest sinner
can repent, and that, if he does, he will be forgiven.
It should be observed that the Talmud
means by a sinner one who does definitely
wicked actions&mdash;a sinner morally, not theologically.
It should also be observed that, in the
above story, the idea of an intercessor, by
whom God might be moved to pardon, is
pointedly rejected. The sinner does not plead
either the merits of the Fathers, as might have
been expected, or the merits of Christ, as
according to Paul he ought to have done, if
his peace with God were to be made. That
he was forgiven, and that anyone in like case
would be forgiven upon repentance, is the
emphatic declaration of Pharisaic belief.</p>

<p>The Rabbis were fond of moralising upon
the case of Manasseh, the idolatrous king;
and the following passage contains one of
the lessons they drew from it (j. Sanh. 28<sup>c</sup>).
Manasseh, after he had been carried captive to
Babylon and sat in prison there, said to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>self:
"'I remember how my father caused me
to read in the house of assembly this verse
(Deut. iv. 30), "When thou art in tribulation,
and all these things shall befall thee, in the
latter days thou shalt return to the Lord thy
God and shalt hearken to His voice. For the
Lord thy God is a merciful God; He will not
fail thee, nor destroy thee, nor forget the
covenant He made with thy fathers." Lo, I
will say that, now. If God hear me, it is
well; if not&mdash;&mdash;.' But the ministering angels
desired to shut the windows of heaven, so that
the prayer of Manasseh might not ascend to
the Holy One, blessed be He. For they said
before Him, 'Lord of the worlds, wilt thou
receive in penitence a man who has set up an
image in thy sanctuary?' He answered them,
'If I received not him in penitence, lo, I bar
the door against all penitents.' What, then,
did the Holy One do? He made an opening
beneath His throne of glory, and He heard
his prayer. And this is what is written
(2 Chron. xxxiii. 13), 'And he prayed unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Him, and He was entreated of him, and heard
his supplication and brought him again to
Jerusalem.'"</p>

<p>I have given these stories just as they stand,
with their quaint and childish notions, because
they reflect very clearly the fixed belief of
their authors that man is not prevented from
finding forgiveness and peace from God. He
can always repent; and, if he does, God
will always forgive him. That this belief
makes possible a sort of easy presumption of
forgiveness is a danger of whose reality the
Pharisees were well aware; and they were
careful to warn against it. But they never
wavered in their belief that forgiveness did
always follow on sincere repentance; and that
no sinner need ever remain cut off from God
by the barrier of his sin. The definite precepts
of the Torah were divine commandments, certainly.
But they did not make the Pharisee
feel that if he disobeyed them there was no
longer any hope for him, any possibility of
ever finding his way back to the love of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
The passages I have quoted, and there are
many others, and scores and hundreds of sayings
about repentance which all teach the
same lesson, are the utterance of Pharisees, of
men who were steeped to the lips in Rabbinism,
who gloried in the Torah, who delighted in
the abundance of its precepts, and the consequent
casuistry of the schools, and who felt in
their hearts that love of God which they did
their best to show forth by serving the Lord
with gladness in the doing of His commandments.</p>

<p>However great be the difference between
the Pharisee and the Christian in the form
given to their respective conceptions of
religion, the contents of their spiritual experience
were to this extent alike, that for
each there was, and is, the sense of personal
relation to, and communion with, the Divine
Being. For the Christian, at least for most
Christians, the medium of that communion is
Christ. For the Pharisee there is no medium;
but there is, as the guide to show the way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the light to shine upon it, the Torah. The
Pharisee did not bring to his religious conceptions
the penetrating power of analysis
which has been applied by Christian theologians.
There has never been a Pharisee
who could have done what Paul or Augustine
did in this respect, unless it was Maimonides.
There will therefore not be found in Pharisaic
literature the subtle distinctions of justification,
sanctification, prevenient grace, etc.,
which abound in the great Christian writers.</p>

<p>But, none the less, the main terms are found,
and the spiritual realities thereby signified
were known in Pharisaic experience. Grace
was known. The Holy Spirit was known.
Faith was known. These and other of "the
deep things of God" were objects of real
experience and devout contemplation. Pious
fancy played round them, and represented
them in parable and allegory; but they were
seldom if ever made the subject of close
philosophical examination, nor were they
formulated in defined doctrines.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Much is said about the Holy Spirit in the
Pharisaic literature, without any attempt to
make all that is said consistent. But, behind
all such utterances, there is the unwavering
belief in the direct communion of God with
man. The Holy Spirit was naturally most
often referred to in the case of the prophets, in
whom its manifestation was most conspicuous.
But its influence is implied in the fact of
prayer, and is nowhere denied in regard to men
in general. "Whatever the righteous do,
they do it by the Holy Spirit." That is the
utterance of a Pharisee (Tan&#7717;. Vaje&#7717;i, xiii.
p. 110ª), and it is the key to the whole
Pharisaic conception of the relation of man
to God.</p>

<p>So, too, in regard to Faith, while the word
does not appear so often on the pages of the
Talmud as it does in the Epistles of Paul, the
thing was an essential element in the religion
of the Pharisees as it was in that of Paul.
They never defined precisely what faith meant;
it appears as a simple and unquestioning trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in God; and they thought about it after
a simple fashion, without, however, being
thereby shown to be wanting in it. "Great
is faith," says a Midrash (Mechilta Beshall. ii.
6, 33<sup>b</sup>). "For Israel believed in Him who
spake and the world was; and as a reward for
believing in the Lord, the Holy Spirit rested
on them, and they uttered a song: as it is
written, 'They believed on the Lord....
Then sang Moses, etc.'" (Exod. xiv. 31; xv. 1).
"And so you find" (continues the Midrash)
"that Abraham our father did not inherit this
world and the world to come except by the
merit of faith, because he believed in the Lord.
As it is written, 'And Abraham believed in
the Lord, and He counted it to him for righteousness'"
(Gen. xv. 6). R. Nehemiah said,
"Everyone who receives even one commandment
in faith is worthy that the Holy Spirit
should rest on him." So even the Pharisees
could appeal to the same Abraham, whom
Paul called as a witness against them; and
they did so with the most obvious sincerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
as having a perfect right to do so, and
probably with complete ignorance that the
Christian apostle had appealed to Abraham in
support of his argument against their religion.
And it was well done of the compiler of the
Midrash to add the closing words of the
passage I quoted; for I know of hardly any
other saying which so illumines the inner side
of Pharisaism as this, that "Every man who
receives even one commandment in faith is
worthy that the Holy Spirit should rest on
him."</p>

<p>In all that I have said in the course of this
chapter, I have had before me the purpose of
showing what is true about the religion of the
Pharisees upon those points which are affected
by Paul's condemnation. True, Paul condemned
it as a whole, as a system of thought
and practice fundamentally and in principle
contrary to what he regarded as the truth.
But he only alleged certain features of
Pharisaism as the sign and expression of its
defect. He alleged its reliance upon the Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and its consequent non-reliance upon Christ.
He drew certain conclusions from its alleged
defects, and his conclusions have been accepted
as valid ever since. I have therefore tried to
show chiefly on these points what the Pharisees
themselves thought and felt and believed;
and have left out of notice other aspects of
Pharisaism which were not challenged, and
which might have been challenged with more
reason than those which Paul actually chose.
He might have made a strong case against the
particularism of the Pharisees in comparison
with the universalism of his own Gospel. For
though it can be shown that the Pharisaic
conception of religion did not exclude universalist
ideas in regard to mankind in general,
yet it can hardly be questioned that such ideas
were but seldom touched upon and by no
means conspicuous in the ordinary thought
and debate of the Pharisees. Moreover, the
Torah itself, which was to them so all important,
was given only to Israel, and could serve
only them as a means of salvation. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Gentiles were to profit by it, they must do so
in fellowship with Israel. And that made real
universalism impossible, whatever might be
the aspirations of this or that particular Rabbi.
God offered the Torah, says the Midrash, to
all the nations of the world; and all refused it
except Israel. They had their chance, and
rejected it. That is for Jews a not unnatural
view, but it does not lead to universalism.
Yet, if Paul had challenged Pharisaism on
this its weakest side, instead of aiming his
blows at an unreal creation of his own brain,
he would not have been left unanswered.
The Pharisees would have replied, "True, we
have not grasped the idea of universalism in
any effective way. But what does your own
universalism amount to? Only to this, that
amongst the elect, those whom you say God
chooses out to be saved, the distinction of Jew
and Gentile does not count. But neither for
you nor for us is there any question of his
actually saving all men. There is no real
universalism at all. And there is this between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
us, that you tell of the wrath of God poured
out on all mankind except the elect; you tell
of Christ who in some way is the means of
saving those elect; you hold that life in this
present world is only a temporary captivity in
an evil state from which there will be a speedy
release at the coming of Christ in glory. To
us there is no Christ; for we need none,
except the Messiah, who shall come when
God shall please, and who will do otherwise
than he of whom you speak. But we need
none to save us from our Father in Heaven,
and none to persuade Him to forgive when
else He would turn away. And this present
life, in this present world, is to us not a vale of
tears or a captivity in an evil state. It is the
scene of our service of God. And that Torah,
of which you have said such hard things,&mdash;you
who once gloried in Torah yourself, and must
have known, though now you have forgotten,
how it was once "the light of all your seeing,"&mdash;that
Torah is to us the guide of life, that
shows us how in the small deeds of every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
we can, if we will, do that which is pleasing to
God. Yes, we fail sometimes; and as your
own master said, "even if we did all the
'mitzv&#333;th,' we should still be but unprofitable
servants, having done only that which was our
duty to do." Still, we serve Him with heart
and soul, the best we can; and we count it
nothing to have done only the mere act prescribed,
without the intention of pleasing Him.
We look to Him as our help and our shield,
our Father and Lord, our strength and our
redeemer. And He does not turn away from
us. Go you and worship Him as you will;
and if the Torah no longer says aught to you
of what once it said, then seek the revelation
of God elsewhere, and hear his voice in other
tones. As for us we will "abide in the things
we have learned, knowing from whom we
have learned them." And so long as we are
faithful to the trust that God committed to
Israel, when He made him a nation, and gave
him the Torah and raised up the prophets,
and sent psalmists and wise men to teach their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
brethren, so long "may the Lord God be with
us as He was with our fathers."</p>

<p>It is the Pharisee who has kept the promise
of Israel; and to these latest days he keeps it
still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smcap">Some Points of Pharisaic Theology</span></h2>


<p>In the second chapter it was pointed out that
the development of the religion of Torah, in
the centuries from Ezra to the Pharisees and
on to the Talmud, took place along two main
lines. These are indicated by the two words
Halachah and Haggadah. Upon the meaning
of the former I dwelt at some length; but,
for the sake of clear and adequate treatment,
it seemed better to defer the consideration of
the latter. The thread then dropped I shall
pick up now; for the answer to the question
"What was the theology of the Pharisees?"
is given in the Haggadah. This is true in
more senses than one; for to understand what
is meant by Haggadah is to understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Pharisaic mode of approaching questions of
doctrinal theology, while a comprehensive
knowledge of all that they taught upon such
questions could only be obtained by a survey
of the whole mass of Haggadah contained
in the Rabbinical literature. To accomplish
anything like that would need a very large
volume. Weber devoted a whole book to it;
and he might well have written a second, to
include all that he had left out of the first.
It will meet the purpose of the present work
to explain the way in which the Pharisees
dealt with doctrinal theology, and to illustrate
this by reference to some main heads of belief,
choosing such as may serve to throw light on
references in the New Testament to Pharisaic
doctrines. I shall then be in a position to
use the results obtained for an explanation, in
the final chapter, of the remarkable difference
in character and tone between the Pharisaic
religious discourse and that of the New Testament
teachers&mdash;a difference felt by all who
are able to compare the two literatures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>For the purpose of the present inquiry I
must again remind the reader that the religion
of Torah, since the time of Ezra, was based
upon the belief that God had made to Israel
a full and final revelation, had given a body
of teaching, for their guidance and enlightenment
upon all matters in which the divine
and the human came into contact. The
vehicle of this revelation, the written record
of it, was the Pentateuch, called therefore
the Torah, <i>par excellence</i>. But all the other
Scriptures were considered to be of divine
authority, and only subsidiary to the Pentateuch,
because they helped to make clear its
meaning. Further, what was implicit in the
divine revelation, written in the Pentateuch
and amplified in the other Scriptures, was
rendered explicit in the oral interpretation.
And whereas the <i>litera scripta manebat</i>, unaltered
in form and quantity, the oral interpretation
continually increased in amount and
in multiplicity of detail, as being an ever more
full and exact exposition of the contents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the original revelation. To use a mathematical
simile, the whole Torah might be
compared to the sum of an infinite series,
written in definite symbols, and made to
express a more detailed concrete result by
the progressive evaluation of its terms.</p>

<p>It is evident that for the religion of Torah
the prime necessity was to know the meaning
of the Scriptures in general and of the
Pentateuch in particular. The oral Tradition
started with the interpretation of Scripture;
and never in its furthest flights of allegorical
extravagance or daring imagination did it
wholly forget or entirely disown its connection
with the written word. The connection is
not always easy to trace; but it is there, none
the less. The Tradition of the Elders, wherever
it be examined, and whatever be the
subject of its pronouncements, is, from first
to last, and from its highest to its lowest, the
declaration that, when God gave the Torah
to Israel, "this" and "this" and "this" is
what he meant by it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>When Ezra and his successors made it their
chief task to study and interpret the written
Torah, what they looked for before everything
else was direction for <i>doing</i> the divine will.
The reasons why they took this line have
already been explained, and need not be repeated
(see above, Chapter II.). The effect was
that in the body of tradition gradually formed,
the element of precept was the most conspicuous
and the most systematically developed. It
was essential that the Jew, desiring to serve
God, should know exactly what he was commanded
to do, and what he was forbidden to
do, and what was the right course to take in
cases where no divine command or prohibition
had been explicitly given. The Halachah
was the answer to these questions; being of
the nature of a comprehensive rule of right
conduct, and intended to cover every possible
occasion on which a decision was called for.
The results, obtained by proper methods of
interpretation, and recognised as valid by
competent authority, were clear and definite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and could only be disputed by showing that
in fact the real intention of Scripture was
otherwise. Hence it was possible to elaborate
a consistent system of Halachah, and eventually
to codify it all.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But the interpreters of Scripture found more
in its pages than precept; the Torah taught
other things besides directions for doing the
divine will. It contained instruction about
God Himself, about Israel's relation to Him,
about the creation and divine providence as
shown in past history, about human virtues
and vices, and the divine approval or disapproval
of them, and so on. It was the
task of the interpreters to set forth this
teaching, as well as the positive or negative
precepts. It is probable that the early
Sopherim described their work of interpretation
as a whole by the word Haggadah; or,
rather, that they used the cognate verb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
"higgid" to indicate that the Scripture "declared"
so and so. But when they began to
develop the special line of Halachah, the
meaning of what had been the more general
term was restricted so as to denote all the
remainder that was not Halachah. This is,
in practice, what Haggadah does mean,
namely, interpretation of Scripture in all
other directions except that of precept.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> As
a technical term, indeed, the actual word
Haggadah may be no earlier than the first, or
even the second, century of our era; but that
method or process of interpretation which it
was used to describe was in practice long before.</p>

<p>Haggadah, then, covers the whole field of
scriptural interpretation except so far as it
relates to precept; and this is why the contents
of the Haggadah are so much more diversified
than those of the Halachah. One might truly
say that the Haggadah is the Pharisaic com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>ment
upon life as a whole in the light of
Scripture, the element of duty being reserved
for special treatment.</p>

<p>If the Scripture could give even a hint upon
any aspect of human nature, upon any phase
of human experience, upon any attribute of
God, upon any mystery of His providence,
then the unfolding of the true meaning of
that hint is Haggadah.</p>

<p>It will be clear, from what has been said,
that all the subjects usually included under
the term doctrinal theology would find their
place under the head of Haggadah. Such are
the doctrine of God, His existence and attributes;
the doctrine of sin and restoration; the
doctrine of revelation; the doctrine of "the
last things," etc. And it is quite true that
whatever the Pharisees taught upon those
subjects is found in the Haggadah and not in
the Halachah. But there will not be found a
consistent system of doctrine upon these or
any other subjects; there will not be found a
detailed scheme of heads of belief. There will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
be found the utterances of individual teachers,
sometimes diverging widely from the opinions
of other teachers upon the same subject.
There will be found, not indeed a complete
and unrestricted license to any man to say and
teach and believe what he liked, but a liberty
to differ where each had what seemed to him
good warrant for his belief. <i>Uniformity of
religious belief was never required by the
Pharisees</i>; and the most that was done in
that direction was to recognise that there were
certain limits beyond which a Jew could not
go and still remain within the Jewish communion.
Thus, even if he claimed to prove
from Scripture that there were other gods than
the One, he would cease to be acknowledged
as a Jew. Or, if he said that the Torah was
not from Heaven, <i>i.e.</i> was not a divine revelation,
he would in like manner be regarded as
no longer a Jew. But (to put it generally), if
he loyally accepted the axioms and postulates
of Judaism, then he was free to draw his own
conclusions from them in regard to what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
believed. The Rabbis never drew up a
doctrinal creed; and when Maimonides did
so, in the twelfth century of our era, he did
what was felt by many to be uncongenial to
the spirit of Judaism.</p>

<p>This absence of a system of doctrinal
theology is a feature of Pharisaism which is
most important for the right understanding
of it; and Christian scholars have gone far
astray through not being aware of this essential
fact. Weber proclaims his error in the very
title of his book, <i>A "System" of Ancient
Palestinian Synagogue Theology</i>. There is
much to be learned from Weber's book, and
much that is extremely valuable to those who
know how to use it; but, none the less, the
whole conception of Pharisaic theology expounded
in that book is fundamentally wrong,
because Weber calls that a system which
never was a system, and never set out to be.
Christian doctrinal theology is capable of
being presented as a system; and has, in fact,
been so represented by almost every denomina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>tion
of Christians. Weber presumably had
such a system on Lutheran lines. He took
for granted that there must have been a
system on Pharisaic lines; in other words,
that the doctrines of Pharisaic belief were
developed from fundamental principles with
such logic as was admissible, and were consistent
with each other. He therefore took
the general scheme of his own Christian
theology, and set down under its several heads
what he could find of Rabbinical doctrine
upon each point. He must have been perplexed
by the want of agreement amongst his
authorities, but he got over that by regarding
the more prominent doctrine as the rule, and
the other as the exception; the former was a
part of the system, the latter was an aberration.
Christian scholars are pathetically grateful to
Weber for having given them an orderly and
methodical arrangement of the medley of
Pharisaic doctrine; certainly he has done so;
but with as much success and as much truth
as if he had described a tropical jungle, believ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>ing
it to be a nursery-garden. Many people
have seen a nursery-garden. Few have seen
a jungle. It is easy and natural and highly
convenient to identify the unfamiliar with the
familiar; but the jungle remains a jungle, when
all is said and done.</p>

<p>The meaning of which is this, that the
Rabbis adjusted their beliefs to the Torah;
they believed whatever they found there, or
could deduce from its plain statements and
obscure hints, or could shelter under its
sanction. It never troubled them that what
they found in the Torah was not always
mutually consistent. One teacher drew forth
<i>this</i> lesson, and another drew forth <i>that</i>, and
a third something different. But what then?
Only that the Torah contained these various
lessons; and why should not they all be
learned? For had not God given them all?
What he said had many meanings, and was
not exhausted by one interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
if contradictory conclusions were drawn, they
were not on that account any the less divine
truth. It was said (j. Ber. 3<sup>b</sup>), in regard to
the controversy between the school of Hillel
and the school of Shammai, "The words of
each are the words of the living God." And
that applies to the whole field of the Haggadah.
If the results of interpretation were arrived at
by legitimate methods, and declared by competent
teachers, then they were received as
valid. Not indeed that anyone was required
to believe what was stated in them. That
was not the intention of the teacher. Haggadah
was above all things meant for edification;
it presented religion under a great variety of
aspects, and by means of an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
wealth of illustrations drawn from the whole
field of knowledge and experience. To learn
this was good, by reason of the variety; the
religious thought of the learner was enriched,
his moral nature benefited, and his spirit continually
refreshed by the contemplation of the
everchanging aspects of divine truth. Uniformity
would have made that impossible; to
have required it would have been fatal; and
to suppose that it was required is to miss the
point of Haggadah, which is what Christian
scholars usually do.</p>

<p>If a Jew were told by some teacher a piece
of Haggadah, he would be impressed by the
wisdom or the beauty of the thought contained
in it, or perhaps would admire the skill which
drew it forth from some obscure hint of
Scripture; but he would never say to himself,
"I must straightway believe this; if I do not,
I shall be in error, and in peril of my soul."
He would more likely say, "Blessed art thou,
Abraham our father, from whom has sprung
such a teacher for Israel." And observe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Haggadah is still Torah. It is an exposition
and application of what is implicit in the
divine revelation, drawn forth and made articulate.
Yet, even so, there is no demand
made for the acceptance, as an article of belief,
of each Haggadic exposition. The Jew, and
notably the Pharisee, knew what faith was, as
well as the Christian did; but he did not make
it the regulator of his attitude towards that
which was taught him as the contents of
revelation.</p>

<p>I have said that Haggadah is interpretation
of Scripture in all directions except that of
precept. And that is true; but the term
"interpretation" must be taken in a very wide
sense. A connection of some kind there always
is between Scripture and Haggadah; but it is
sometimes extremely slight. For the Haggadic
interpreter performed his task in two ways:
either he developed what he believed to be the
real teaching of Scripture upon this or that
point; or he sought to find in Scripture a
sanction for truths which he already believed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
And not merely for definite truths, but for
anything which might tend to edification,&mdash;ethical
principles, mystical speculations, meditations
on providence and the wonders of
creation, the imaginings of pious fantasy, and
even the play of daring wit. There was
nothing that could not find a place in the
Haggadah, if it could be linked on to some
text or word or letter of Scripture. The
methods employed were, from the point of
view of strict exegesis, often wildly extravagant.
No freak of allegory, of word-play, of
fantastic juggling with letters and syllables, is
without illustration in the Haggadah. And
the men who employed such methods knew
well that what they were setting forth was not
the plain literal meaning of Scripture. What
they saw, with their inward vision, was the
divine truth, holiness, justice, beauty, goodness,
love; they read it in their own experience,
and traced it in nature and history and man.
They looked to see it all mirrored in Scripture;
for there was the divine revelation, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
all that they believed to be divine must be.
Some of it could be plainly seen; for, in
essentials, the Haggadic teaching upon ethics
and piety kept to the main lines of the Scriptures.
What could not be plainly seen was
inferred to be there; and no hint was too
slight to indicate its presence. We say that
this means reading into the text what is not
there. And doubtless that is the case. But
the Haggadist did not so understand what he
did. If he was conscious of ideas, thoughts,
beliefs, which he felt to be variously good,
then, since Scripture was for him the only
vehicle of divine revelation, somewhere in
Scripture must be indicated all that various
good. And any method was justified by
which it could be brought forth and made
clear. That I take to be the theory of the
Haggadah, the explanation which a Haggadist
would give of the reason for his peculiar treatment
of Scripture. Haggadah, like Halachah,
is a natural, perhaps even a necessary, development
of a religion of Torah. Both are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
integral parts of Torah; and a thorough
understanding of the nature and function of
each is necessary for the understanding of
the whole. Halachah and Haggadah, together
with the personal spiritual life of
the individual, cover the whole field of the
religious consciousness of the Pharisee. For
it is entirely wrong to say that the Pharisee
was wholly taken up with the Halachah, the
discipline of direct precept. No Pharisee that
ever lived confined his thoughts and aspirations,
his beliefs and hopes, within the range
of Halachah, nor could have done if he had
tried. He guided his conduct by the Halachah
certainly, because he believed that by following
it he was doing the will of God exactly
as it ought to be done. But the Halachah
did not teach him, and did not profess to teach
him, how he should think about God, nor did
it seek to regulate his own private communion
with his Father in heaven. For this last he
sought no other teacher except the promptings
of his own soul and the answer of God to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
prayers. And for the knowledge of God's
nature and His works in providence and
human history, he gladly learned from any
wise and gifted teacher who could tell him
anything, or in any way help him to think
wisely, to worship devoutly, to live worthily.
I shall have more to say about this in the
concluding chapter. I only mention it here,
because it was necessary to show the place
which the Haggadah occupied in the religious
thought of the Pharisee, and how it did for
him what in other religions is done by a
scheme of doctrinal theology. For the present
I keep to the subject of the Haggadah itself,
and proceed to inquire what can be learned
from it as to the main heads of Pharisaic
belief, especially in the period covered by
the New Testament. It is mainly for the
sake of this inquiry that I have given the
foregoing explanation of the nature and intention
of Haggadah.</p>

<p>The inquiry is by no means an easy one.
For, while it is only necessary to open a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
volume of the Talmud, or of one of the
great Midrashim, to find on almost every
page some Haggadic utterance, often indeed
a great mass of Haggadah, it is wholly unwarranted
to say "this" and "this" is what
the Pharisees believed. It may be; and, of
course, if it were not in some way acceptable
to Pharisaic minds, according to their
canons of judgment, it would not be found
in their books. But the Haggadah does not
carry its meaning on the surface, nor yield it
to the hearer or reader who has only a passing
glance for it or a careless ear. And thus,
what really represents the truth believed, or
the good discerned, the element to which the
mind assented, and which it gratefully received,
is not expressed in the verbal form
of the Haggadah, nor in its statements,&mdash;extravagant
and even impossible as they
sometimes are. There was no idea of taking
those statements as they stand, as if they
were to be accepted as true, and believed as
divine revelations. When it is said by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Haggadist that since the creation God has
been occupied in making marriages (Ber. R.,
p. 133<sup>c</sup> § 68. 4), that does not represent as it
stands what any Pharisee, or the Haggadist
himself, really believed about God. As George
Eliot truly says of that particular Haggadah,
"The levity of the saying lies in the mind of
him who hears it"; and, as she might have
added, puts a frivolous meaning on it. The
Haggadah is full of such things; but the
Haggadah is not on that account frivolous or
absurd. And when the unwary Christian
produces specimens of Haggadah, and says,
"See what those Rabbis believed and taught,"
the foolishness which he illustrates is not that
of the Rabbis. To get at the real meaning
and serious purpose of Haggadic teaching is
one of the difficulties in the inquiry into what
the Pharisees believed. In itself it is not a
great difficulty, but it needs to be recognised.</p>

<p>A further difficulty is presented by the
question, how far can the utterance of some
individual teacher be taken to represent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
generally accepted belief, seeing that there
was no requirement of uniformity of belief?
To that question a decisive answer is scarcely
ever possible, except within wide limits of
probability. If a doctrine can be formulated
upon some topic of theology, it will represent
a <i>de facto</i> consensus of belief, rather than the
conscious acceptance of the teaching of any
authority; and those who held the belief might
still prefer a different statement of it. Everywhere
caution is necessary in drawing forth
from the Haggadah its real meaning, and in
forming conclusions as to the generality of its
acceptance.</p>

<p>A still further difficulty, and one which is
of especial importance for the purpose of this
book, is that of using, for comparison with the
teaching of the New Testament, Haggadah
often of much later date. Of the enormous
mass of Haggadah contained in the Rabbinical
literature, only a small proportion is contemporary
with the Gospels, and very little indeed
contemporary with Jesus. One of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
famous Haggadists was R. Joshua b. Levi, in
the middle of the third century of our era. If
we find that he teaches some doctrine, are we
entitled to use his words as evidence that such
doctrine was believed by Pharisees in the time
of Jesus and the Apostles? If not, then, of
course, the appeal to the Talmud and Midrash,
in illustration of Pharisaism in the New Testament
period, is futile. Here, again, caution
is necessary; but, with caution, the answer is
that the later literature may rightly be used
as evidence of earlier beliefs and ideas. We
have already met the same question in reference
to the Halachah (see above, Chapter II.).
And the answer there was that the <i>principle</i>
of Halachah was accepted, and the development
of that principle was begun long before
the time of Christ. What changed continuously
through the centuries was the body and
form of ascertained Halachah, determined by
the gradual expansion into greater detail of
its precepts, and their application to a greater
variety of cases. The Halachah, as codified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in the Mishnah, is much more extensive than
the Halachah as it was known to the Pharisees
in the time of Jesus. But the intention of it
is the same for the earlier period as for the
later. Wherefore it is legitimate to use the
Talmud to illustrate the principle of Halachah
as accepted in the New Testament period, as
also for the periods before and after; but it
would not be safe to infer that some particular
definition, propounded by Akiba or Judah the
Holy, was already regarded as Halachah, and
taken for a rule of conduct by the contemporaries
of Hillel and Shammai. Now, with
regard to the Haggadah, the case is somewhat
different, because, as has been already explained,
no uniformity of belief was required,
while uniformity of practice was required.
But, allowing for that difference, what was
said about the use of the later literature in
regard to the Halachah applies also to its use
in regard to the Haggadah. For here, also,
there is an element which does not change,
or not to any great extent, over a period which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
includes that of the New Testament and a
considerable time before and after. That
element is the general Pharisaic belief about
God, Israel, and the world, about man's relation
to God and to his fellow-men, about
virtues, vices, the nature of sin, the function
of prayer, and so on. What the Haggadah
did was to teach this, illustrate it in all manner
of ways, and present it in every possible aspect,
but not in any great degree to modify it.
Indeed, I think hardly to modify it at all.
There is, in Pharisaism, no such progressive
development of doctrine as there is in Christianity.
Of course there could not be, in
the nature of things, a Pharisaic Christology.
But there was no progressive doctrine of a
Messiah, nor of the Torah, nor of the resurrection
of the dead, nor, I think, of any of the
main subjects of belief. There were general
ideas commonly held upon these subjects,
beliefs upon which there was substantial
agreement, and no thought of challenge. And
the Haggadah was the means by which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
general body of belief was continually illustrated
and illumined, so that it might have
ever renewed power to refresh the soul. Just
as the Halachah was the detailed application
of Torah to conduct, on its practical side, as
the doing of the divine will, so the Haggadah
was the detailed application of Torah to the
spiritual life generally, so that the light which
God had given might be shed over the "things
which are eternal."</p>

<p>I proceed to sketch out what I take to be
the general beliefs of the Pharisees which form
the background, or the substratum, of the
Haggadah, so far as I have been able to make
it out. Afterwards I will give some Haggadic
illustrations upon particular points. I purposely
do not attempt a systematic arrangement,
because the Pharisees themselves did not.</p>

<p>The object of worship is God&mdash;one, and
undivided. He is the Creator of the world
and of everything in it; and no other being
shared with Him in that work. He does
what He will; but His will is always just.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
His providence supplies the wants of His
creatures. He is good, kind, and merciful.</p>

<p>It is the duty of man to obey Him. He
has made known His will; He rewards those
who fulfil His command, and punishes those
who disobey. He has made all the human
race; but Israel stands in a special relation
to Him, because only Israel is bound to Him
by a covenant. The Torah was offered to
the other nations, but they would not have
it. They are therefore outside the range of
God's favour. They can only come within
it by learning from Israel the Torah. There
are, nevertheless, good men amongst the other
nations.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of Israel to have been
found worthy to receive the Torah, and his
highest aim is to fulfil it, not only by doing
what it sets before him as the divine will, but
by taking to heart all that it teaches him
concerning sacred things.</p>

<p>The Pharisee believed himself to be under
the immediate care of God. Nothing happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to him except by the divine permission. God
sees, and knows all that he does and all that
he is going to do. Nevertheless, his will is
free. He is not compelled either to obey or
to disobey. If he obeys, God is pleased with
him. If he disobeys, God is angry with
him. Reward will follow in the former case,
punishment in the latter. If he has sinned,
repentance will make his peace with God.
Forgiveness is never refused to the penitent.
He can always pray to God, and God will
always hear him.</p>

<p>It is his duty to be kind towards his fellow-men,
"especially towards them which are of
the household of the faith"&mdash;namely, Israel.
He must not wrong anyone, whether Jew
or Gentile. He must especially do acts of
charity towards the poor and the suffering.
He must not live an idle life; and in all that
he does he must serve God.</p>

<p>Although at present he has much to endure,
yet there will be in the future a better time,
when the Messiah shall come and set up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
kingdom of God upon earth. Then Israel
will be freed from the oppression of the
Gentiles, and will enjoy peace and prosperity
and the fulness of the blessing of God. When
that shall be, no one knows. God will send
the Messiah when it pleases Him to do so.
But the sins of Israel hinder his coming.</p>

<p>When life on earth is over, there is a life
beyond the grave. For the righteous there
is Heaven, where they will be rewarded; and
for the wicked there is Hell, where they will
be punished. The righteous in Heaven will
live for ever. The wicked in Hell will be
destroyed and made an end of. There will
be no chance to repent after death.</p>

<p>Man is under the protection of angels, and
liable to temptation and harm from evil
spirits. There are many such, and there is
a prince over them. The angels are God's
messengers. Each man has in himself two
opposing impulses or tendencies; one towards
good and the other towards evil. It is his
duty to control the evil impulse and strengthen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the good one. God will help him to obey
the good, and will not prevent him from
yielding to the bad. To keep his mind fixed
on the Torah, and filled with its teaching,
is his protection against sin and his incitement
to right living. He is glad that the
Torah gives him so many precepts to fulfil,
because it thereby constantly reminds him of
God, and provides opportunities for serving
Him. The Torah is the centre and circumference
of all his thoughts and beliefs about
religion. In it God has revealed everything
that He has revealed at all. It is the greatest
gift He could make, and He has bestowed it
all on Israel, and kept nothing back.</p>

<p>Such, in bare outline, and purposely stripped
of all details, I believe to have been the contents
of the religious consciousness of the
Pharisees in general, the beliefs and ideas
common to them all. In different periods,
according to circumstances, there would be
variety in the emphasis laid upon particular
points.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance there might be, as there
certainly was, more than one period when the
group of beliefs centring on the Messiah rose
into exceptional prominence, and were held
with more than usual fervour. And, again, the
destruction of the Temple in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70, and the
final overthrow of the Jewish national polity
in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 135, had a profound influence upon
Pharisaic belief, by laying additional stress on
faithfulness to the divine will, and by causing
deeper reflection upon the mystery of that
will as shown in the suffering of Israel. The
Pharisees deplored, with sincerest grief, the
loss of the Temple and the cessation of
its services. But they were well able to
learn the lesson of a worship and a religious
life, for which such external means were needless.
And they did learn it with wonderful
rapidity.</p>

<p>So, too, for individuals according to temperament,
some elements of the general belief
would have more importance than others; and
there would be, further, a great variation in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
strength of conviction with which the beliefs
were held, as also in the character of those who
held them. It is clear that such a general
conception of religion could open a way for
the faults of pride and hypocrisy, charged
against the Pharisees, as it also could open
the way for the virtues of humble piety and
sincere devotion. It probably did the one. It
certainly did the other. There were good,
bad, and indifferent Pharisees, as there are
good, bad, and indifferent Christians. And all
that I am concerned with at present is the
general Pharisaic consensus of belief, thought,
and feeling upon divine things.</p>

<p>If I have described it correctly, then it
represents the underlying meaning of the
Haggadah; and whatever is contained in the
Haggadah is intended to illustrate, or enforce,
or make prominent, some aspect of those
beliefs. It matters nothing that there is endless
variety, and frequent contradiction, in what
the Haggadists say, <i>i.e.</i> in the form in which
they clothe their thoughts; nor that they make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
statements which are extravagant, or impossible,
or absurd, or grotesque, or even occasionally, in
appearance at least, irreverent. What really
was in their mind was the underlying religious
truth or ethical principle which they sought to
illumine. That was their serious intention;
and it is not a denial of this if it be admitted
that, like all interpreters who use the method
of allegory, they occasionally let their fancy
run riot, and indulged in freaks of exposition
whose connection with religion is not obvious.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Trivialities of that kind, however, may be left
out of account.</p>

<p>It will be of more use to take some of the
points of the foregoing sketch of Pharisaic
belief, and examine them in greater detail.
And the first shall be the doctrine of God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
more particularly certain aspects of the doctrine
of God.</p>

<p>Between the Pharisees and the New Testament
teachers there was no dispute as to the
sole sovereignty of God, or that He was the
Creator and upholder of all things. But it
is well to lay stress upon the Pharisaic belief
in the nearness of God and the directness of
access to Him; also to make clear the fact
that emphatic resistance was offered by the
Pharisees to any idea of a plurality of divine
persons. They would own no being who could
be regarded either as in some sense a second
God, or as a mediator between God and man.</p>

<p>That the Pharisees commonly thought of
God as a cold abstraction, a distant and inaccessible
Power, is by Christian scholars
frequently but quite erroneously asserted.
Of course, it was never denied that God was
the Almighty, the Lord of all worlds, supreme
over everything. Indeed, that was affirmed
over and over again, and is one of the axioms
of Pharisaic belief. But, whatever other Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
may have done, under the influence of Hellenism,
the Pharisees never doubted for a moment
that God Himself, the one supreme God, was
actually near to every one of His people;
"near, in every kind of nearness," as it was
said (j. Ber. 13ª). That is the really effective
belief of the Pharisees, as can be seen on well-nigh
every page of the Talmud and the
Midrash. How it was to be reconciled, if it
needed to be reconciled, with the belief in the
abstract infinity of God, was a question which
the Pharisees never troubled to answer, even
if they were aware of it. There was no Jewish
philosophy of religion till long after the closing
of the Talmud. And the Pharisees most
certainly did not logically develop their conception
of God from their idea of the Torah.
Whether, even if they had done so, they would
have arrived at the barren abstraction, which
Weber declares to have been the Pharisaic
idea of God (Weber, <i>System</i>, etc., p. 149), is
open to question. But they never allowed
any theoretical reasoning which would prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
them from owning the love and goodness of
God, or which would place an impassable gulf
between Him and His creatures. The following
piece of Haggadah illustrates this point: "It
is said (Exod. xx. 1), 'And God spake all these
words.' He doeth the whole at once (<i>i.e.</i> in
one action). He kills and He makes alive, in
one action. He wounds and He heals, in one
action. The woman in travail, those that go
down to the sea, travellers in deserts, captives
in prison, east and west, north and south, He
hears them all, in one act (of hearing)"
(Shem. R. p. 50<sup>b</sup>). And a few lines further on
it is stated that He spoke all the ten commandments
in one act (of speaking). There is
here no attempt to explain <i>how</i> God, being
Almighty, can take particular notice of persons;
there is the unquestioning belief <i>that</i> He does
so. He may be high in Heaven, but no suffering
creature of His suffers unseen or unheard.
"A bird perishes not, without Heaven" (<i>i.e.</i>
except by the will of God); so said a great
Pharisee, in words that have a striking likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to a saying of Jesus on the same subject
(j. Sheb. 38<sup>d</sup>, and cp. Matt. x. 29). A story
is told (Debar. R. 102ª) of a certain Jew who
was on board a ship, where all the other
passengers were Gentiles. The ship touched
at an island, "and the sailors said to the Jew,
'Take money and go ashore, and buy something
for us.' He said, 'I am not at home
here; how shall I know where to go?' They
said, 'A Jew is at home everywhere. For
whithersoever thou goest, thy God goeth with
thee.'" (The reference is to Deut. iv. 7,
"What great nation hath a God who is so
nigh to them.")</p>

<p>The nearness of God is especially emphasised
in relation to prayer. He hears all who pray
to Him, and it is He himself who hears and to
whom prayer should alone be offered. "Every
man," says the Talmud, "has a 'patronus'
(a 'friend at court'). If there comes trouble
upon him, he does not go direct to his patron,
but goes and stands at his door, and calls to
the servant or to a son of the house, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
tells the patron 'So and so is standing at the
door of thy court.' Perhaps the patron has
him admitted. Perhaps he leaves him alone.
But the Holy One, blessed be He, is not so.
If trouble comes on a man (God says), 'Let
him pray, not to Michael and not to Gabriel,
but to me, and I will answer him at once.'
And this is that which is written (Joel ii. 32),
'Everyone that calleth on the name of the Lord
shall be delivered'" (j. Ber. 13ª). Here we
have not only the declaration of belief in direct
access to God Himself through prayer, but also
the repudiation of any mediator. Michael and
Gabriel may be servants of God, but they
do not come between God and man to keep
them apart or to serve as the necessary medium
of intercourse. They were never, in Pharisaic
theology, allowed any place which might seem
to impair the divine Unity. The idea of a
second God was steadfastly resisted; and no
personification of divine attributes, or exaltation
of archangels, was ever carried so far as
to imply a plurality of persons in the Deity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
As against the doctrine of the Logos, and the
Christian exaltation of Christ, the Pharisees
maintained the strict unity of God. Neither
the Memra of the Targums, nor the Shechinah
of the Talmud and the Midrash, however
personified for Haggadic purposes, was regarded
as being in any sense a personality
co-existent with God Himself. The Holy
Spirit was either God, or the influence of God,
but not a personality distinguishable from Him.
Metatron comes the nearest to the conception
of a second God; but, whatever the later
Cabbalists may have made of Metatron, the
Pharisees of the Talmud expressly rejected
the notion that he was a second God. It
is told (b. &#7716;ag. 15ª) that the famous Elisha b.
Abujah, the nearest approach to a Jewish
heretic, went up into Heaven (Paradise), and
there saw "Metatron, to whom was given
power to sit and write down the merits of
Israel." (Elisha) said: "It is taught that on
high there is no sitting, no strife, no parting,
and no joining. Can there be, Heaven forbid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
two powers? (<i>i.e.</i> two Gods). They brought
out Metatron, and gave him sixty lashes of
fire." The commentator on this passage
explains that Metatron was treated in that
manner in order to show that he was not
superior to the other angels in kind, and that
he was subservient to God, not on any sort of
equality with Him. Metatron, as I have elsewhere
maintained,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is the Rabbinical reply to
the Gnostic and Christian doctrines which
seemed to threaten the divine Unity. It was
perhaps with reference to Christian doctrine
that the Rabbis laid stress on the belief that
God has no Son. Commenting on Exod.
xx. 2: "R. Abahu said: 'A parable of a king
of flesh and blood; he reigns and has a father
or a brother. The Holy One, blessed be He,
saith, "I am not so"; (but) (Isa. xliv. 6) "I
am the first," I have no father; "and I am
the last," I have no son; "and beside me
there is no God," I have no brother'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>(Shem. R. 51<sup>b</sup>). Abahu lived in the third
century of our era; and most of the Haggadic
expositions of the unity of God, on the lines
indicated, are later than the New Testament
period. But, as they were only developed in
opposition to Christian teaching, it is not
likely that in the time of Jesus or the Apostles
the Pharisees were divided or uncertain upon
a point which had scarcely as yet been challenged.
Jesus himself never challenged it, so
far as the Synoptic Gospels are evidence; and,
upon a belief so fundamental in Pharisaic
Judaism, it is not to be supposed that he was
more consistent than the Pharisees themselves.
The challenge came not from Jesus but from
Paul, even though Paul may not have intended,
or been conscious of, any infraction of the unity
of God in his teaching about Christ. The
Pharisees took the alarm from him; and, in
opposition to his Christology, and the later
Johannine doctrine, taught with especial
emphasis the undivided sole supremacy of
God. And they had no more difficulty than
Jesus had in believing that the one God was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
both sovereign Lord and heavenly Father, as
in fact they called Him.</p>

<p>So much for the Pharisaic conception of
God. We will now consider another set of
beliefs of theirs upon which a comparison
with New Testament teaching is possible and
instructive&mdash;the Pharisaic ideas about Retribution,
reward and punishment, merit. There
is no consistent Pharisaic doctrine upon the
subject, but rather a comment upon the facts
of human experience from different points of
view. That man's will is free is one of the
axioms of Pharisaism. It was stated by R.
Akiba, "Everything is foreseen, and freedom
is given, and the world is judged, and all is
according to the amount of work" (M. Aboth.
iii. 15). Man is therefore a moral agent,
cognisant of the distinction between right and
wrong, capable of acting upon that distinction,
and liable to be judged accordingly. "All is
in the hand of Heaven except the fear of
Heaven," said another teacher (b. Ber. 33<sup>b</sup>).
If, then, man serves God, he does so not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
compulsion. He is therefore subject to the
approval or disapproval of God for what he
does. Experience, interpreting life, discerns
evident tokens of such approval and disapproval;
and Scripture clearly teaches that God
distinguishes between the righteous and the
sinner in His treatment of them. Whatever
form His approval or disapproval may take,
they are His certain judgment on human
actions, to be looked for as the consequence
of doing those actions.</p>

<p>The Pharisees, like other moralists, expressed
this by saying that God rewarded the good
and punished the bad. And they used that
principle as a clue to the meaning of providence,
as shown in human suffering and happiness.
They pondered on the problem why suffering
should be inflicted on the apparently innocent?
and why the obviously sinful seemed often to
prosper? And they suggested various partial
solutions of the problem, but wisely left it an
open question. It might be that there was no
suffering without previous sin, or it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that suffering was sometimes the chastisement
imposed on the righteous through the love of
God, as it is said: "Whom the Lord loveth
He chasteneth." It might be that material
prosperity and adversity were the signs by
which the divine approval and disapproval were
shown, the reward or the punishment for
human actions; or it might be that these were
manifested only inwardly, in the soul and not
in the outward lot. All these different views
find varied expression in the utterance of
Pharisaic teachers, and there is no attempt to
set up one as true to the exclusion of the rest.
And when the Pharisee spoke of reward and
punishment, he meant to indicate his belief
that in some way it went well with the man
who did good, and ill with the man who did
wrong, and both by the divine appointment.</p>

<p>In the Gospels, Jesus also speaks of reward,
as every reader knows; and many readers have
winced when they read:&mdash;"Pray to thy
Father, ... and thy Father shall <i>reward</i>
thee." "Great is your <i>reward</i> in Heaven."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"If you do good to them that do good, what
<i>reward</i> have ye?" Phrases like these have an
unpleasant sound, wherever they occur, because
of the notions commonly attached to the term
reward. No one supposes that Jesus, in using
that term, was appealing to low motives of
self-interest; and I believe that he meant
exactly what I have given as the Pharisaic
meaning, namely, that there was a divinely
appointed difference between the condition of
the good and that of the bad, as a consequence
of their actions. It is at least not justifiable
to say that Jesus must have meant what he
said, according to its best interpretation, and
that the Pharisees must have meant what they
said, according to its worst interpretation.
Jesus was one, and the Pharisees were many;
and while he remained ever on the highest
plane of spiritual wisdom, the Pharisees represented
different degrees of that wisdom. Some
might, and occasionally did, interpret divine
reward and punishment in terms of material
welfare, while others saw more deeply into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
spiritual meaning of those terms. But it is
not true that the material interpretation represents
the general belief of the Pharisees, while
the spiritual interpretation is the exception.
The truth is that they would not reject any
interpretation which might throw some light
upon the problem; and they cared nothing
that different interpretations contradicted one
another.</p>

<p>So far, there is no essential difference, that
I can see, between the Pharisaic teaching and
that of the Gospels, or the New Testament
generally, about reward and punishment. The
difference that does exist is due to the fact that
Pharisaism was the religion of Torah. For
here the divine approval or disapproval was
necessarily associated in an especial degree
with the "Mitzv&#333;th," the precepts which expressed
the will of God for the conduct of
man. To say that there is a reward for doing
a "Mitzvah" is no more out of keeping with
true piety than to say there is a reward for
praying to the Father which seeth in secret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
In each case it only means that the act of
devotion to God, whatever form it take, is
acceptable to Him, and His blessing is given
to the doer of it. Now, the Mitzv&#333;th were
clearly-defined, specific acts; and the Pharisee,
as has been already pointed out in a previous
chapter, regarded them not as irksome constraints,
but as welcome opportunities for
serving God. The more Mitzv&#333;th he could
meet with the better. If, by doing them, he
could thereby please God, what more could
he wish for? Certainly he looked for reward;
but the joy of service and the blessing of God
was the reward he looked for. That is the
real mind of the Pharisee in regard to reward.
And if some Pharisees interpreted the blessing
of God in a material sense, to be shown in
outward prosperity, while others interpreted it
in a spiritual sense, that is only a difference of
temperament as between particular Pharisees.
What the reward should be, in what way God
would show His approval and give His blessing,
was as God should please. The Pharisee served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Him with gladness and zeal; and only hoped
(as Christians also have been invited to hope)
that God might say to him: "Well done, good
and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy
of thy Lord."</p>

<p>It was a Pharisee who said, "The reward
of one Mitzvah is the opportunity to fulfil
another" (Aboth. iv. 5); and perhaps no words
could better indicate the Pharisaic view of
reward in the service of God. The service is
everything; the reward is God's way of showing
that the service is acceptable. Moreover,
the reward, if it were expected to be anything
more than the present consciousness of divine
approval, was not looked for in this world,
but would be part of the bliss of the world to
come. "Thou wilt find," said a Rabbi, "no
single Mitzvah in the Torah, to which a reward
is attached, which does not depend on the
raising of the dead. 'Honour thy father and
mother, that thou mayest prolong thy days,'
and 'that it may be well with thee.'... 'That
thou mayest prolong thy days' in a world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
which is endless, and 'that it may be well
with thee' in a world which is wholly good"
(b. &#7716;ull. 142ª). And again it is taught, "What
is that which is written (Deut. iv. 7) 'which
I command thee to do them this day?'" To
do them <i>this day</i>, and not <i>to-morrow</i>. To <i>do
them</i> this day, and not to <i>receive the reward</i>
this day" (b. Kidd. 39<sup>b</sup>); and on the same
page is the express statement, "Reward for
a Mitzvah in this world there is none." Of
the nature of the reward this is said: "The
world to come is neither eating nor drinking,
nor increasing and multiplying, nor giving and
receiving, nor jealousy, nor hatred, nor strife;
but the righteous sit with crowns on their
heads, and enjoy the light of the Shechinah"
(b. Ber. 17ª).</p>

<p>Such ideas were in the minds of the Pharisees
when they spoke of the reward for doing the
will of God; ideas not hardened into a formal
doctrine, and perhaps by some only dimly
apprehended, but yet indicating a vision of
divine things not very unlike what has floated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
before the gaze of Christian souls. But while
the Pharisees thus delighted to muse on the
reward, they were emphatic in teaching that
the "Mitzvah" was not to be done for the
sake of the reward, as if to obtain thereby
some payment of what was due. The distinction
is somewhat fine, especially as the reward
hoped for was spiritual bliss and not material
advantage. But the Pharisees drew the distinction,
nevertheless. Thus it is said, in
reference to Ps. i. 2, "His delight is in the
law of the Lord." R. Eliezer says, "Who
delighteth greatly in his commandments." "In
his commandments (Mitzv&#333;th), but not in the
reward of the Mitzv&#333;th" (b. A.Z. 19ª). The
sole reason allowable for doing a Mitzvah
is the hope of pleasing God thereby. And
then follows the well-known saying of the
ancient Antigonos of Socho: "Be not like
servants who serve their master for a reward."
These are only a few instances out of many
to show that the Pharisee was not actuated
by motives of the kind which are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
ascribed to him in his performance of the
things commanded him. If to an ideal so
lofty and so austere, the Pharisee sometimes
failed to rise, and said what was not worthy
of it, there is no cause for wonder, since the
same may be observed amongst Christians,
and is merely due to individual human nature.
But the Pharisaic conception of religion in
general, and of this phrase of it in particular,
is entitled to be judged by the best to which
it looked up, and not to be condemned for its
occasional failure to apprehend that best.</p>

<p>Finally, what about merit? The Pharisees
were never afraid to talk about merit; but
what they said must be taken in the light of
what has already been stated. They had no
fixed doctrine of merit; and there certainly
never was a general Pharisaic belief in a system
of bargaining with God as between debtor and
creditor on business lines. This or that teacher
may have used the terms of such transactions
by way of illustration; but they do not represent
the general mind of the Pharisees upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the subject. The Pharisees certainly believed
that to perform many Mitzv&#333;th was better than
to perform one; and they not unnaturally concluded
that there could be no more reasonable
criterion for a judgment of character than the
use which a man had made of the opportunities
afforded by the Mitzv&#333;th for serving God.
Mitzv&#333;th, being specific commands, could be
counted up; and the degree of goodness shown
in doing them, or of badness in not doing
them, could be thought of quantitatively,
instead of qualitatively. This is not, for
obvious reasons, the best way of treating the
matter; and the Pharisees have, in consequence,
come in for a great deal of rebuke and contempt
for having degraded the relation of man
to God, when all that they did was to use an
unfortunate metaphor in order to express a
real distinction. It was perhaps mainly through
the use of this metaphor, this quantitative description
of goodness, that they laid themselves
open to the charge of boastful self-righteousness;
and no doubt they were occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to blame in that respect. Because a Pharisee
was able to observe, in a quite dispassionate
way, the fact that he had performed so many
"Mitzv&#333;th." It would have been better for
him not to have learned that method of self-examination.
But, nevertheless, it is true,
though only those who know the Pharisees
can be expected to believe it, that genuine
humility could and often did go along with
that candid estimate of good performed.</p>

<p>This accumulation of goodness, through the
performance of "Mitzv&#333;th," is what the Pharisees
meant by merit, "Zachuth." And though
they were not in the least ashamed of it, nor
saw why they should be, they were careful to
keep the idea of merit within limits. Like the
reward hoped for, the merit acquired was not
a motive, but an accessory. They believed,
certainly, that merit counted for much with
God. As has been said, they believed that
He judged men according to whether the
goodness of their deeds or the badness was the
greater; in other words, by the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
merit which they possessed. But they did not
presume to set up a claim against Him; and
while they pleaded merit before Him, they were
taught that it was not their own merit they
should plead, but that of others. "He who
pleads the merit of others is answered for his
own; and he who pleads the merit of himself
is answered for that of others" (b. Ber. 10<sup>b</sup>).
Very often it was the merit of the Fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whose influence
with God great effect was ascribed. Yet what
is all this but the idea of intercession, of the
good on behalf of the less good? And as
between Pharisaic and Christian ideas on the
subject, the difference is more in the form than
the substance. Even the appeal to the merits
of the Fathers was discouraged by many Pharisees,
on the ground that it tended to shift
responsibility for a man's own conduct on to
someone else. They never for long forgot
that, nor wavered in their trust that God was
a just and loving God, into whose hands they
need not fear to commit themselves. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
simplicity of heart, rather than with profound
philosophical acumen, they mused on their
experience of life in the light of Scripture and
in the thought of service of God; and if they
did not get much further than the conviction
that it is well with the righteous and not well
with the sinner, that God knows all and will
deal justly with all, that some of His ways are
plain to be seen, and others past finding out,
and that the whole duty of man is to fear God
and keep His commandments; and that the
highest joy is to serve Him with gladness, and
in doing justly, and loving mercy to walk
humbly with Him,&mdash;who will say that they
are very far wrong?</p>

<p>This was the practical purpose of the Pharisees,
the aim of their serious intention, and, in
no inconsiderable degree, the measure of their
achievement.</p>

<p>I have dwelt upon these two aspects of
Pharisaic theology as being of most importance
for my main purpose in this book. To include
all that could be said would defeat that purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
by wearying the reader. I have therefore left
unnoticed such topics as the belief in the
Messiah and the group of ideas connected
with Eschatology; and I have done so in order
to concentrate attention upon what is of fundamental
importance, namely, the point of
view from which the Pharisees looked upon
religious belief and the truths apprehended in
it, the special character imposed upon their
general conception of things divine, by the
form of Torah in which all their religious
thought was cast. What has been learned in
regard to the two theological topics dealt with
in this chapter can be applied to others; and,
in any case, the general mind of the Pharisees
has, I hope, been made easier to understand.</p>

<p>If it has, then I trust to be able to carry
the reader with me in what I shall say in the
concluding chapter of Pharisaism as a spiritual
religion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smcap">Pharisaism as a Spiritual Religion</span></h2>


<p>In this concluding chapter I shall make an
attempt to indicate what Pharisaism was on
its spiritual side, as the expression of the
Pharisee's personal feeling towards God; or,
if I may put it in colloquial terms, what the
Pharisee "felt like" as a religious and moral
being. I shall try to show the meaning of the
peculiar type of character formed under the
influence of the religion of Torah, both as
regards its excellencies and its deficiencies.
I say its deficiencies, for my aim throughout
this book has been not to extol the Pharisees
as if they had no faults, but to present, as
clearly and strongly as I could, what they
meant by their religion and what it meant to
them. To say that they held to it with sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
loyalty, and that they found in it entire satisfaction,
is not to say that it had no limitations, so
that there could not be a more excellent way.
But it is to say that Pharisaism was a genuine
religion, so far as it went, able to satisfy the
real wants of living souls. And how far it
went, and where it stopped short, is a question
upon which the adherent of another form of
faith may have a decided opinion, and yet
may be entirely mistaken. The Christian
may be able, and I hope that the reader will
have been able, to recognise that Pharisaism
was a genuine religion. But the peculiar form
in which that religion was expressed makes
it exceedingly difficult for the Christian to
recognise in Pharisaism what is familiar to
him in his own religion; and, in consequence,
he is extremely likely to misjudge and depreciate
what to the Pharisee was right and
good. My task in this chapter is very far
from easy; and I am by no means confident
that in performing it I could satisfy a Pharisee
that I have done full justice to his case.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject is somewhat intangible, being
indeed the inner consciousness of the Pharisee
in regard to religion. I shall deal with it
under three heads: first, the devotional literature
available; second, the influence of the
conception of Torah as a factor in the formation
of religious character; and, third, the
result of that influence.</p>

<p>The devotional literature properly so called
of the Pharisees, at all events within the
period covered by the Talmud, is not extensive.
I mean by devotional literature, writings in
the form of hymns and prayers. Of hymns
there are, in this period, so far as I know,
none; of prayers there are a few; some of
them included in the liturgy of the Synagogue,
and others being individual private prayers.
This very meagre list may, however, be
extended; certainly in one direction, and I
believe also in another. Some of the Psalms
ought to be included as being lyrical expressions
of the religion of Torah, whether the
writers were technically Pharisees or not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
And, in the other direction, the liturgy of the
Synagogue is the precipitate of Jewish piety
through many centuries, and shows better
than anything else how much of deep spiritual
fervour was engendered by the religion of
Torah. I shall make use of the Psalms, or
some of them. But of the Synagogue liturgy
I shall use only such parts as fall within the
period covered by the Talmud. Because
my concern is with the Pharisees of the
early centuries, not with those of the Middle
Ages. And, though I believe it to be the
case, I could not prove that a Pharisee of the
first century of our era would feel that his
thoughts about religion found due expression
in the hymns of Jehudah ha-Levi and Ibn
Gebirol. Personally, I believe he would; but
the fact remains that the Pharisees in the
Talmudic period composed no hymns, and
that fact must be allowed for whatever it
is worth. The reappearance of devotional
poetry must correspond, one would think,
to some change in the spiritual atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
But, in regard to the use of the Psalms,
there need be no such hesitation. Some of
the Psalms are unmistakably due to the
influence of the conception of Torah in determining
the form of religion; and the whole
Book of Psalms was used by the Pharisees
in the Synagogue service, and for their own
study. This latter fact does not prove very
much, because the whole of the Old Testament
was also used and studied; and no one would
contend that the Old Testament is throughout
an utterance of Pharisaism. Still, it should
be remembered that the Canon of the Old
Testament was fixed by Scribes and Pharisees;
and that the book of Psalms was finally
completed, and in part composed, for use in
the Synagogue and the Temple, as the lyrical
expression of the religion of Torah.</p>

<p>I shall therefore make such use of the Psalms
as will help my purpose, and will supplement
the study of them by an examination of the
few Pharisaic prayers to be found in the
Talmud and the early liturgy. Something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
was said about the Psalms in the second
chapter, and I shall not repeat it. Here I
would go into more detail upon particular
points.</p>

<p>On looking through the Book of Psalms,
it is seen at once that there are some which
proclaim themselves unmistakably as Torah
Psalms. Notably, Ps. cxix. and the second
part of Ps. xix. It is quite inconceivable that
these should have been written before Ezra
had instituted the religion of Torah. Ps. i.,
also, the general introduction to the whole
collection when finally completed, evidently
moves within the circle of ideas associated with
Torah. Occasional phrases in other Psalms may
also reveal the same fact, even though the particular
Psalm, as a whole, may not be specially
devoted to the thought of Torah. Thus, in
Ps. xxv. 10, the reference to "covenants" and
testimonies, and in Ps. xviii. 22, "statutes and
judgments." Indications like these, however,
cannot be safely relied on; because, as stated
in the second chapter, there was Torah before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Ezra, and such phrases as those just quoted
occur in Deuteronomy. The Psalms in
which phrases are found, such as "Torah,"
"covenant," "testimony," "statute," "judgment,"
"precept," and the like, may be interpreted
in various ways, and not necessarily in
terms of the specific religion of Torah due to
Ezra. But there is no need to draw any hard
and fast line between those which are and
those which are not Torah Psalms; for the
religious frame of mind peculiar to the Torah
Psalmist can be studied in detail in Ps. cxix.
That is a Pharisee Psalm, beyond any question.
I do not mean that the writer can be shown to
have been a Pharisee in the technical sense, a
member of a pledged company of separatists.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Very likely he was; but whether he were so
or not, he looked upon the Torah exactly as
the Pharisees did, as the supreme and perfect
revelation of God.</p>

<p>Ps. cxix., as everyone knows, is made up of
groups containing eight verses, each beginning
with one of the twenty-two letters of the
Hebrew alphabet. There are thus one hundred
and seventy-six verses in all. From an artistic
point of view, the structure of the Psalm is
stiff and mechanical; the divine name is introduced
twenty-two times, corresponding to the
twenty-two groups of verses. The changes are
rung upon a series of ten words&mdash;Torah,
statute, righteousness, precept, judgment, way,
ordinance, word, saying, and faithfulness&mdash;the
number corresponding, perhaps, to the ten
commandments given on Sinai. With one
exception, v. 122, every verse contains one or
other of the ten words in the list just given.
The result is a certain monotony, and the
Psalm is not amongst those most generally
admired and loved by the ordinary reader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Whether there is any progression of thought
is open to question; it would not, apparently,
make very much difference if the verses were
rearranged according to another pattern. But
once we get past the barrier of artificial method
there is thought and feeling in abundance.
The one object of thought is the Torah; and
the feeling is devout wonder in regard to it,
and adoration of God who gave it. The ten
words are only so many aspects of Torah, and
serve mainly to give variety to the thought of
the divine revelation.</p>

<p>The Psalmist meditates upon the Torah,
thus variously indicated, from two points of
view: first, that of its divine excellence and
the goodness of God in revealing it; and,
second, that of his own endeavour to fulfil
the precepts contained in it. In reference to
the first head, it is clear that the Psalmist was
filled with delight, gratitude, and praise. The
Torah and all connected with it inspired him
with joy. There is not the faintest trace of
any feeling of oppression, as if he were burdened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
by the precepts; and, for what is not precept
but simply instruction, he received it with
devout rapture, as being a precious gift which
God had been pleased to bestow. That God
had given that revelation was to the Psalmist
the greatest of all his blessings. There is in
the Psalm but little reference to the past
history of Israel, as showing the divine providence.
The Psalmist was deeply conscious
of God in the immediate present, and of his
own close relation to Him. Of course, the
Torah, so far as it was a written record,
included the history of all the divine dealings
with Israel, down to the time of Moses; but
it was not this aspect of religion which chiefly
appealed to the Psalmist. The providential
mercy of God served to give fuller and richer
meaning to the thought of Him as the object
of worship. The following phrases will serve
to indicate the Psalmist's attitude towards
God:&mdash;v. 7, "I will give thanks unto Thee
with uprightness of heart." v. 12, "Blessed
be Thou, O Lord; teach me Thy statutes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
v. 18, "Open Thou mine eyes, that I may
behold wondrous things out of Thy Torah."
v. 41, "Let Thy loving kindness come unto
me, O Lord; Thy salvation, according to Thy
promise." v. 49, "Remember Thy word unto
Thy servant; for Thou hast caused me to
hope." v. 57, "Thou art my portion, O Lord."
v. 64, "The earth is full of Thy mercy, O Lord."
v. 68, "Thou art good and doest good." v. 75,
"I know, O Lord, that Thy judgments are
righteousness, and that in faithfulness Thou
hast afflicted me. Let Thy loving kindness
be for my comfort, according to Thy promise
unto Thy servant. Let Thy tender mercies
come unto me, that I may live." v. 90, "Thou
hast established the earth and it abideth. They
stand this day, obedient to Thine ordinances;
for all beings are Thy servants." v. 132, "Turn
Thou unto me, and have mercy on me; as
Thou usest to do unto those that love Thy
name." And v. 176, "I am like a lost sheep;
seek Thy servant." These are only a few of
the characteristic phrases of the Psalmist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
He evidently feels towards God reverence,
trust, and hope; and, no less evidently, does
not feel that God is far off and unapproachable,
an abstraction rather than a living presence.
God was, for the Psalmist, the creator of the
world; but He was also the guide and protector
of those that know Him and keep His commandments.
And it was the privilege of such
that they should have been allowed to know
Him, and hold communion with Him. The
Torah was the means by which that privilege
was made available to Israel; and the "precepts,"
"ordinances," etc., were the particular
occasions on and through which that privilege
might be realised and enjoyed, and the devout
worshipper might come into communion with
God. The Psalmist never lost sight of the
purpose of the precepts, in the mere doing of
what they enjoined. For him the doctrine of
the <i>opus operatum</i> would have been a frivolous
and mischievous perversion of the truth; in
modern phrase, a "soul-destroying heresy."
There is nothing of the taskmaster in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Psalmist's conception of God; he does not
indeed call Him the Father in Heaven, but
that term would more truly express his thought
than any phrase of bondage and compulsion.
And we can see how naturally the term Father
in Heaven would take its place in the language
of devotion, when once it had occurred to
someone so to use it.</p>

<p>The Psalmist's conception of God, though
it is mostly defined in relation to Torah, does
not contradict in any way that which is set
forth or implied in the rest of the Psalms, or
in the highest teaching of the prophets. Compare
Ps. ciii., by common consent one of the
noblest utterances of pure spiritual theism that
the Old Testament contains:&mdash;"But the mercy
of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness
unto children's children; unto such as keep
His covenant, and to those that remember
His precepts to do them." In Ps. ciii., the
changeless mercy and love of God are especially
dwelt on&mdash;His forbearance towards human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
frailty; while in Ps. cxix. the main thought
is of God as having given Torah, divine teaching.
But neither Psalmist excludes what the
other chiefly dwells upon. The Psalmist in
Ps. cxix. cannot be said to have narrowed the
conception of God. He was in accord with
all that the prophets and the other Psalmists
had believed of the greatness and goodness of
God. What this Psalmist did was to utter
his praise of God, so conceived, from the point
of view of the means of grace which He had
given, the conditions which He had appointed
for personal knowledge and service of Himself.
Unless this be understood, Ps. cxix. is wholly
misjudged; and the fact that it appeals less
than almost any other Psalm to the reader,
at all events the Christian reader, is due to
unfamiliarity with the Psalmist's point of view.
Once that is found, the whole Psalm shines
from end to end with pure devotion and fervent,
genuine piety.</p>

<p>Second, as to the Psalmist's feeling in regard
to his own efforts to fulfil the precepts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to live in accordance with the Torah. As
these were to him the means of realising his
personal relation to God, and of entering into
communion with Him, he was not in despair
when he failed in obedience. He prayed for
forgiveness, believing that, if he repented, God
would forgive him. When he broke a precept,
he sinned and knew that he sinned; but he
was not conscious of having thereby set up
an insurmountable barrier between himself and
God. A barrier certainly; but one which
penitence on his part and forgiveness on that
of God both could and did remove. All the
ideas about bondage under the Law, to which
Christians have been accustomed, rest upon a
conception of the meaning and purpose of the
Torah which Jews have never held, at least
those who remained Jews. The writer of
Ps. cxix. never held it.</p>

<p>This Psalm is marked by careful, sometimes
almost painful, introspection. The Psalmist
is continually dwelling upon the precepts as
they affect himself, his love for them, his desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to keep them, his delight in them, his longing
to learn them, and to be more perfectly in
accord with them, his fear lest he should wander
from the way of them. Indeed, the whole
Psalm is made up of such meditation, in forms
varied but continually repeated. Which goes
to show that a Psalm written under the immediate
influence of the idea of Torah could
scarcely fail to be introspective. And this
Psalm is an illustration, on a fairly large scale,
of the fact that the change effected by the
work of Ezra, in turning the religion of Israel
into the channel of Torah, tended to make
that religion far more personal and individual
than it had been before.</p>

<p>The value of Ps. cxix., as evidence for the
spiritual meaning of Pharisaism, is this, that
it shows what was possible under the religion
of Torah, by way of piety and devotion. The
Pharisees held precisely such ideas about
the Torah as are expressed in this Psalm;
and I know of no ground for saying that
they were without the piety and devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
with which the Psalmist quickened those
ideas.</p>

<p>As has already been said, the Talmudic
literature does not contain any hymns by
Pharisees; at least, I have never met with any.
Perhaps the Pharisees felt that the Psalms
gave them all that they needed; perhaps they
lacked the gift of sacred poetry. But though
there are no hymns in the Talmud and the
Midrash, there are prayers, both public and
private; and these will throw some light upon
the spiritual side of Pharisaism. The earliest
prayers of all are those which form the opening
and the close of the so-called Eighteen Benedictions,
the "Shemoneh Esreh." These are
ascribed, in the Rabbinical tradition, to the
Men of the Great Synagogue; and though so
great an age cannot be proved for them, it is
certain that they are very old. They are the
earliest existing portions of the liturgy used
in the Synagogue; and though they are somewhat
bare in their unadorned simplicity, they
serve to show something of the religious spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of the men who were making "a hedge about
the Torah," and they indicate that there was
something else in that operation besides waning
faith and waxing formalism. I quote one
or two of them:&mdash;"Blessed art Thou, O Lord
our God and the God of our fathers, the God
of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. God
most high, creator of Heaven and earth, our
shield and the shield of our fathers."... "We
give thanks to Thee, O Lord, our God, for all
the benefits, the favours, which Thou hast
shown to us. Blessed art Thou, to whom it
is good to give thanks. Bestow Thy peace
upon Israel, Thy people, and bless us all as
one. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest
peace." These prayers, as they are found in
the liturgy now, are very much longer; I have
given what are believed to be the oldest parts
of the three which I have quoted out of the
eighteen. If there is not much warmth in
these prayers, as there certainly is not, neither
is there any of the vainglory and self-righteousness
which are supposed to be characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of the Pharisees. And it should be borne in
mind that there can be no great difference in
date between these prayers and Ps. cxix.</p>

<p>However, I will come down to a time when
the Pharisees, if they ever became such as the
New Testament represents them, must have
long acquired that character. Here is a prayer
which dates from the second century of our
era, and is part of the liturgy still in daily
use:&mdash;"Lord of the worlds! not trusting in
our righteousness, do we cast our entreaties
down before Thee, but trusting in Thine
abundant mercies. Who are we? What is
our life? What is our virtue? What is our
righteousness? What is our deliverance?
What is our strength? What is our might?
What shall we say before Thee, O Lord God
and the God of our fathers? Are not all the
mighty as nothing before Thee? and the men
of name as though they had never been? And
the wise are without knowledge, and the
understanding as those who are without discernment.
For the multitude of their deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
is nothing, and the days of their life are a
breath before Thee" (b. Joma. 87<sup>b</sup>, mentioned
by R. Jo&#7717;anan). Christians usually get their
notion of what a Pharisee's prayer was like
from Luke xviii. 11, 12; and I do not deny
that Pharisees may sometimes have prayed
after that manner. Nevertheless, what I have
just recited is more true to the real spirit of
Pharisaism than the prayer in the Parable.
And even to that there is another side. A
well-known prayer, still used in the liturgy,
runs thus:&mdash;"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our
God, King of the world, that Thou hast not
made me a Gentile ... a slave ... a woman."
Much scorn has been poured out upon those
who have offered that prayer, as if it were
nothing but the utterance of arrogant vainglory.
But, however it may sound to Gentiles,
what the Jews meant, and mean, by it is this,
that God is thanked for having given in the
Torah the opportunity of serving Him, in the
"Mitzv&#333;th," which were not enjoined upon
Gentiles, slaves, or women. It is not self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>-righteousness
which is expressed in that prayer,
but the acknowledgment of special obligation,
a higher calling, in no way inconsistent with
humility and reverence. The prayer in the
Parable was doubtless intended by its author
to represent Pharisaic piety in an unfavourable
light; but the example I have just given is
enough to show that a Pharisee would put a
different interpretation upon it.</p>

<p>Here is another prayer from the second
century (b. Ber. 16<sup>b</sup>), and still in use:&mdash;"May
it be pleasing in Thy sight, O Lord my God
and the God of my fathers, that Thou wilt
deliver me this day and every day from the
shameless and from shamelessness, from the
evil man, from the evil companion, from the
evil neighbour, from evil chance, and from
Satan the destroyer; from stern judgment and
from the implacable adversary, whether he be
a son of the covenant or no." This is merely
a fragment of prayer, as indeed the others are
which I have quoted. It is only a variation
on the theme "Deliver us from evil," the evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
being specified in concrete forms. And, since
it has been incorporated in the liturgy, it
was presumably intended for public use, and
was not the private utterance of its author,
who was R. Jehudah, the compiler of the
Mishnah. This distinction is important, because
it is often charged against the Pharisees
that they reduced prayer, like so much else, to
a mere mechanical routine; that they regulated,
down to the minutest detail, the words and
even the posture and the gestures of the
worshipper; and that they left nothing to the
spontaneous volition of the soul that would
seek God. Certainly there are many such
regulations in the Talmud, both as regards
what should be said and how it should be said.
But these all refer to the public worship of the
congregation, and not to the private prayer of
the individual. Moreover, they are indications
of the process by which the liturgy was compiled,
its contents determined, and the manner
of its use appointed. The worshipper, using the
liturgy, was concerned only with the finally com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>pleted
order, and not with the stages of its preparation.
When the Book of Common Prayer
was compiled, there were discussions as to what
should be included in it and what left out;
whether this phrase or that was to be preferred;
whether at such a point the congregation
should stand or kneel; whether the minister
should face the congregation or not; and
so on.</p>

<p>Presumably, votes were taken, and resolutions
passed upon hundreds of such points.
Are these regulations a restriction upon
worship? Does the worshipper know, or take
any interest in knowing, the details of the
process by which the liturgy was produced?
He accepts the final result; and finds in it a
help to his worship, unconscious of the fact
that perhaps every line has been canvassed by
a committee and settled after debate. Much
the same might be said of the preparation of
any liturgy; and what is found in the Talmud,
which offends the piety of the Christian, is
only the same kind of preparatory work as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
that necessary in the case of any liturgy. If
the Pharisees were extremely careful, as they
certainly were, in deciding what should go into
their liturgy, and how it should be used, why
are they more to be blamed than those who
directed, "Here the minister shall say" so and
so? The Pharisees produced a liturgy which,
gradually enlarged, has lasted down to the
present day; and though a case may be made
out for its revision, still it has served, for many
more centuries than the Book of Common
Prayer can claim, as the expression of the
united worship of Israel.</p>

<p>But, while public prayer was thus carefully
regulated, there was never any restriction,
imposed or thought of, upon private prayer.
It is expressly said (M. Aboth. ii. 13), "When
thou prayest, make not thy prayer a fixed
form, but a prayer for mercy and an entreaty
before God." I do not think that this refers
to public prayer; but, even if it does, it would
still show that the Pharisees were careful to
keep the spiritual intention of prayer, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
using the prescribed form. But I believe the
reference is to private prayer; and it is certain
that this was left to the spontaneous freedom
of the worshipper himself. Prayer was always
an essential element in the religious life of the
Pharisee; not because it was required of him,
but because it was the natural instinct of his
soul. "Would that a man could pray all
day," said R. Jo&#7717;anan (j. Ber. 2ª). Pharisees
knew what it was to withdraw to their inner
chamber, and "pray to their Father which
seeth in secret." And it was not a Pharisee
who added:&mdash;"Thy Father, which seeth in
secret, shall <i>recompense thee</i>."</p>

<p>Of such entirely private prayers there is
no written record. But several prayers are
mentioned in the Talmud as having been
composed for their own use by famous Rabbis.
Here are some of them as they are found
together (j. Ber. 7<sup>d</sup>):&mdash;"May it be Thy will, O
Lord my God and the God of my fathers,
that Thou wilt not put hatred of us into the
heart of any man, nor hatred of any man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
our hearts; and that Thou wilt not put
jealousy against us into the heart of any man,
nor jealousy of any man into our hearts.
And may Thy Torah be our employment all
the days of our life; and may our words be
entreaty before Thee." To which was added
by another Rabbi: "And unite our heart to
fear Thy name; and keep us far from all that
Thou hatest, and bring us near to all that
Thou lovest, and do with us righteousness
for Thy name's sake."</p>

<p>The disciples of R. Jannai used to say this
(on rising from sleep):&mdash;"Blessed art Thou,
O Lord, who quickenest the dead. Lord, I
have sinned against Thee; may it be Thy will,
O Lord my God, that Thou wouldst give me
a good heart, a good portion, a good disposition,
a good understanding, a good name,
a good eye, a good hope, a good soul, a
humble soul, and a contrite spirit. May Thy
name not be profaned among us; and make
us not a byword in the mouth of the people;
may our latter end be not to be cut off, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
our hope the giving up of the ghost. Make
us not to depend on human gifts, and give us
not our sustenance by the hand of men; for
their comfort is small and the shame they inflict
is great. And grant our lot to be in Thy
Torah, with those who do Thy will. Build
Thy house, Thy temple. Thy city, and Thy
sanctuary, speedily, in our days."</p>

<p>R. &#7716;ija b. Abba used to pray:&mdash;"May it
be Thy will, O Lord our God and the God of
our fathers, that Thou wouldst put it into our
hearts to offer sincere repentance before Thee,
that we may not be ashamed before our fathers
in the world to come."</p>

<p>R. Tan&#7717;um b. Iscolastiki used to pray:&mdash;"May
it be Thy will, O Lord my God and
the God of my fathers, that Thou wilt break
and take away the yoke of the evil inclination
from our hearts. For Thou didst create us
to do Thy will, and we are bound to do Thy
will. Thou desirest, and we desire it. And
what hinders us? The leaven in the dough.
It is revealed and known before Thee, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
there is no strength in us to withstand it.
But may it please Thee, O Lord my God and
the God of my fathers, that Thou wilt cause
it to pass away from us, and that Thou wilt
subdue it; and we will make Thy will our
will, with a perfect heart." R. Jo&#7717;anan used
to pray:&mdash;"May it be pleasing unto Thee, O
Lord my God and the God of my fathers, that
Thou wilt cause love, goodwill, peace, and
friendship to dwell in our habitations; that
Thou wilt grant us a happy end and the fulfilling
of our hope; that Thou wilt fill our
borders with disciples, and that we may
rejoice in our portion in Paradise. Make us
to acquire a good heart and a good friend;
and may we awake to find what our hearts
have longed for, and may there come in Thy
presence rest unto our soul."</p>

<p>I have translated these prayers as nearly
literally as our language would allow, so that
the reader may have them as far as possible in
their original form. There is nothing very
sublime about them, none of the eloquence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
fervent rapture. But neither is there any
of the vainglorious boasting supposed to be
characteristic of the Pharisees. They are
sincere, simple, and earnest, so far as they go,
petitions for the granting of things necessary
for the soul as well as for the body. They
may fairly be taken as representative of
Pharisaic piety, in the absence of what is
not within our reach, namely, the devotional
language of the Pharisee's prayer to God in
the solitude of his own chamber.</p>

<p>The illustrations which have been given from
the scanty remains of the literature of piety
left by the Pharisees will have been sufficient
to show a very considerable difference of tone,
character, spirit, between what was produced
under the religion of Torah and what is found
in the New Testament. And the impression
so created is confirmed by the other citations
I have made, in the course of this book, from
the Pharisaic literature. To one who is accustomed
to the New Testament, there is a
certain flatness about the Rabbinical literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a want of the sublime, and still more of the
beauty of holiness, the fervour of faith, the
personal consecration which marks the New
Testament. There is nothing in all the Rabbinical
literature at all like the rapt utterance
in 1 Cor. xiii. That belongs unmistakably to
the new dispensation, and not to the old. The
same may be said of much else in the New
Testament. If I may so express it, there is
a different "feel" about it, quite unlike what
there is about any Rabbinical writing. As to
the fact of this, I imagine there can be no
dispute; but it is well worth the trouble to try
and get at the meaning of it. For it cannot
be dismissed at once as being due to the
spiritual deadness of the Pharisees, the result
of engrained hypocrisy and self-righteousness.
I trust that enough has been said in previous
chapters to show that the Pharisees were
sincere and in earnest about their religion,
however strange to Christians be the forms in
which they expressed their ideas. The very
strangeness of those forms may well prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Christians from recognising the meaning and
worth of the ideas expressed in them, since
Christians could not use those forms for their
own religious ideas.</p>

<p>The question is not whether the Christian
or the Pharisaic conception is the better;
because, both for Christian and for Pharisee
alike, that is a foregone conclusion. The
question is rather, why did the conception of
Torah, which from the time of Ezra was the
controlling factor in the development of Pharisaism,
produce that particular type of piety
and religious character generally, of which so
many illustrations have been given? In what
way did the influence of that conception make
itself felt upon those who devotedly accepted
it and shaped their lives in accordance with it?
Here I get to the second main head of the
present chapter.</p>

<p>The Torah, which, it will be remembered, includes
both the written word and the unwritten
interpretation embodied in the Tradition, was
regarded as containing the full and final revela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>tion
which God had made. It was a body of
divine truth, partly explicit, partly implicit,
according as its contents had or had not been
drawn forth and clothed in words. But it was
truth, to be apprehended and learned, to be
received in the mind by the understanding
before it could be made the guide of conduct
or could minister in any way to spiritual wants.
The reader will remember that all the terms
used in connection with the appropriation of
the contents of Torah are variations on the
theme of teaching and learning. "Talmud,"
"Mishnah," "Midrash," all express these ideas,
and Torah itself is divine teaching. The significance
of this is that the religion of Torah
had its deepest root in the intellectual, rather
than in the moral or spiritual, region of the
mind. The moral and the spiritual were by
no means neglected or unprovided for; very
far from that. But, if I may so put it, they
came in under the intellectual. The moral
sense of the Pharisee was strong, and his piety
genuine, but the exercise of both was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>ditioned
by the contents of the Torah, duly
interpreted. He must be put in possession of
certain knowledge, in order to act either
morally or devoutly. For him, the "seat of
authority in religion," and also in morals, was
the Torah; and, while it is quite true that to a
large extent he made the Torah the exponent of
his own moral and religious conceptions, reading
into it or finding there a great deal which does
not appear on the surface, it is also true that
he regarded it as an external authority to which
he must submit. He had no difficulty in doing
this, since he believed the Torah to be the full
and final revelation of God. It was all good
and holy and divine; and there could be no
surer guide for him in all that he had to do
and all that he could think and believe in
respect of his relation to God. The function
of conscience was, for the Pharisee, not to pass
moral judgments independent of, still less
contrary to, the Torah, but to co-operate with
it, and to confirm its authority. Conscience
would be, in him, clear upon the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
between right and wrong; but <i>what</i> was
right and <i>what</i> was wrong would be decided
by the authority of Torah, not by the immediate
intuition of conscience and reason.
And I think that a Pharisee would be quite
unable to understand how any action could
be right which was not in accordance with
Torah.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Certainly it could not be right for
him.</p>

<p>So, too, in regard to his relation to God and
his worship of Him, the thoughts and feelings
of the Pharisee, the sincere and devout utterance
of his spiritual being, would flow, naturally
and with no sense of compulsion, in the
channels provided by the Torah, in such forms
of belief and such expressions of aspiration as
were in harmony therewith. I lay stress on
the phrase "naturally, and with no sense of
compulsion"; because it is very difficult for
the Christian, whose supreme authority is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the Torah, to realise the position of the
Pharisee in this matter, and to understand
that he did not feel himself to be under
constraint. Of course, wherever there is
authority, there is that which on occasion will
constrain; and the Christian is, to that extent,
no less under constraint than the Pharisee.
But it is not an oppressive burden, though it
may be a hard duty, to submit to an authority
which is owned to be supreme. And the
Pharisee, regarding the Torah as the supreme
authority, since it was the expression of the
will and mind of God, did not feel himself
oppressed by the duty of submitting to it.
He would entirely agree with what was said,
in a very different connection (John viii. 32):&mdash;"Ye
shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free." He claimed that he <i>did</i>
know the truth; it was given him in the
Torah, from God Himself; and in making his
life and thought and action conform thereto,
he found his true freedom. "None is free,"
says the Talmud, "save he who is employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
in the study of Torah" (M. Aboth. vi. 2).
Whether the range of freedom is not wider
when its limits are prescribed by direct
allegiance to a person instead of to a mental
conception like that of Torah is another
question altogether, and one upon which the
Pharisee and the Christian will have each his
own opinion. And while it must not be forgotten
that the Pharisee also owed allegiance
to a person, felt himself to be in immediate
relation to God, looked up to Him and prayed
to Him, yet he would expect to find the intimations
of the divine will in the Torah, and
not in his own intuitions. It is not that the
Pharisee was without the essentials of a
spiritual experience, real faith in God, real
communion with Him, real devotion to His
service; for these he certainly had. It was
that these were realised by him only when
expressed in terms of Torah. Whatever could
be so expressed took its place at once as part
of his religious or moral consciousness. Whatever
could not be so expressed remained out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>side,
or, at best, held no prominent position
in his thought.</p>

<p>The principle here laid down will be
sufficient, I believe, to explain the chief
characteristic differences between the Pharisaic
and the Christian type of mind, disregarding,
of course, individual variations. It has been
pointed out, in a previous chapter (p. 171),
that Christianity in all its forms centres upon
a person, namely, Christ; and that Judaism
in all its forms, and Pharisaism most of all,
centres upon an idea, namely Torah, and will
recognise no person as the object of its
devotion, save only God Himself. This is
not a proud resistance to the appeal of a
great personality; it is simply a natural and
necessary result of making the Torah the
central feature of religious thought. There
cannot be two centres, two authorities both
regarded as supreme. If the Torah be raised
to the highest place, as the expression of the
divine will and the medium of the divine
revelation, then there can be no other to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
divide the allegiance. And not only so, but
the demand, or the appeal, to recognise such
a one can only appear as an infringement of
the sovereign rights of the Torah. A Pharisee
might admit that it was conceivable that God
should have chosen some other means than
that of Torah as the medium of His revelation.
He could not admit that God actually had
done so, without surrendering the Torah
altogether. And this is the ground on which
I said, in the third chapter, that the opposition
between Pharisaism and the religion of Jesus
was fundamental and irreconcilable. Not,
indeed, that the religion of Jesus himself
centred on a person, as the religion of Paul
and all later Christians did; but that Jesus
himself was that person; and his personality
could by no means be expressed in terms of
Torah.</p>

<p>It is evident that devotion to a Person will
produce a type of mind very different from
that produced by devotion to an Idea; and
the difference will be this, that the seat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
moral authority and the source of spiritual
inspiration will be transferred from the Torah
without to the heart, conscience, and reason
within. With the result, of course, of imparting
to these a freshness and vigour which
they had not, and could not have, before.
Certainly, heart, conscience, and reason were
by no means inactive when applied to Torah;
but responsibility for what they did rested on
Torah and not on themselves. They followed,
gladly and willingly, the lead which God had
given in the Torah; but they followed a lead.
But in devotion to a person, heart, conscience,
and reason, so to speak, act from themselves,
and the responsibility rests upon them. And
the note of the character so formed is not
obedience, but consecration of self. And this,
I believe, is the reason why there is such a
marked difference of tone and spirit between
the New Testament and the Rabbinical literature.
The former is the result of the quickening
power of a newly awakened devotion to
a person, while the latter is the result of stead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>fast
and most faithful devotion to an idea.
Nor is that all. The devotion to a person
leads to a different form of expression, as the
experience to be clothed in words is different.
The New Testament contains abundance of
moral and religious teaching, as the Talmud
also does; but the New Testament puts it in
the form of direct appeal to the Christian to
do and be so and so, that he may be a disciple
of Christ, and well pleasing unto God. The
Talmud puts it in the form of maxims of
conduct, or lessons drawn from Scripture, to
be accepted and acted on because they are
portions of Torah, divine truth and wisdom
offered to man, for his good, but not making
any direct appeal to him. And whereas, in
the New Testament, the spiritual fervour of
the teacher could utter itself in the glowing
rapture of Paul, in the Talmud the spiritual
fervour of the teacher (sometimes not less than
that of Paul) was spent upon the study of
Torah: in the one case God was sought and
found through the person of a revealer; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
other, he was sought and found through the
medium of a body of knowledge. The watchword
of the New Testament is Love. The
watchword of the Talmud is Wisdom. And
each can claim, as its ideal, the highest and
fullest and noblest meaning of its own watchword.</p>

<p>I pass to the consideration of another effect
produced by the conception of Torah as the
controlling factor in Pharisaic religion. Within
the lines of Torah there was room for a
highly developed spiritual life, a pure morality,
a devout piety. Also, for warm sympathy
and generous kindness, and in general for the
virtues which make human nature lovable.</p>

<p>All these were present, in varying degree,
as truly as they are present in Christians.
But how about those who stood without the
pale of the Torah? What did the Pharisee
consider to be his relation to them? In
practice, of course, this would depend largely
on the individual Pharisee; and no doubt
examples might be found of every degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
exclusiveness, from tolerant regret for those
who were deprived of the unspeakable blessing
of the divine revelation down to the arrogant
contempt which said (John vii. 49), "This
people that knoweth not the Torah is
accursed." But I shall deal only with the
theory, not with the practice, of the application
of the Torah to "them that are without."
It was said above, that what could not be
expressed in terms of Torah either remained
outside the religious consciousness
of the Pharisee, or, if admitted, held no
prominent place there. It goes therefore
without saying, that Israel's possession of
Torah must influence its attitude towards the
rest of mankind. The Pharisees were by
no means blind to the fact that among the
Gentiles there were "those who feared God
and worked righteousness"; but, if the Torah
was the final and complete divine revelation,
there could not be an equality, still less a real
feeling of brotherhood, between those who did
and those who did not accept the Torah as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the guide of their lives. And this would
remain true, even though there were, as there
was in the best minds among the Pharisees,
a real concern for the Gentile, and a desire
that he too might share in the blessing vouchsafed
to Israel. The Pharisee by no means
rejected the visions of the prophets as, that
"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." But
how could that be realised unless the Gentiles
came in by the way of Torah, and united
themselves with Israel? It was concern for
the Gentiles, amongst other motives, which
prompted the assertion, to be found often in
the Midrash, that when God gave the Torah,
He offered it to all the nations of the world.
They all, except Israel, rejected it; but at
least they had their chance. It was no
arbitrary decree of God which deprived them
of it. His will was to do them good, if they
would have it; and presumably they might
yet have it, if they would. In such ways the
Pharisee looked out across the barrier which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
separated him from the Gentile, not without
the hope and the desire that "all men might
be saved," but unable to see how that could
be brought about, except by the coming of
the Gentile within the lines of the Torah. To
obliterate those lines was necessarily, to the
Pharisee, unthinkable. It would be to renounce
the very blessing for the sake of which
they desired that the Gentiles should come in.
And, even if there were no Gentiles, the
Torah was still the very life and soul of
Israel; to part with it would be death; a
fact to which Israel has borne witness through
the centuries. In the nature of things, the
religion of Torah as held by the Pharisees
could not free itself from Particularism; and
though it could and did cherish a vision of
Universalism, the vision was for the far future,
and only floated fitfully before the gaze of the
Pharisee. It hardly counted amongst those
present realities of his religion of which he
was most conscious, and to which he gave
his chief thought.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>I have tried to indicate what I believe to
have been the effects of the conception of
Torah as the controlling factor in the religion
of the Pharisees, having, so far as I am aware,
no other purpose than to get at the real
truth about them; in other words, to do
them justice. That I have not refrained from
pointing out the deficiencies as well as the
excellences of their form of religion will
show that my object has not been to offer
a mere panegyric upon them; they deserve
better than that. I shall attempt, in conclusion,
to describe the kind of mind and
character produced by the influence of the
ruling conception of Torah, the Pharisaic
ideal aimed at, and more or less realised in
practice. Individual Pharisees, of course,
would present many and marked variations
from the type, just as is the case among
Christians; and I take no account of them,
except to say that whatever may be true in
the matter of the common charges of hypocrisy,
pride, self-righteousness, and the like, is due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to individual defection from the ideal, and is
not an inherent quality in it.</p>

<p>For the basis of such a description of the
Pharisaic ideal, I take a remarkable passage
now included in the Mishnah, in the treatise
called the Pirké Aboth, or Sayings of the
Fathers (M. Aboth. vi. 6). The whole chapter,
which is later than the rest of the book, is
called "The Acquisition of Torah." This is
the passage:&mdash;"Greater is Torah than Priesthood
or Kingship. For Kingship is acquired
by thirty stages (<i>i.e.</i> there are thirty qualities
necessary to the ideal King), and Priesthood
is acquired by twenty-four; but Torah is
acquired by forty-eight things. And these are
they:&mdash;Study, the listening ear, ordered speech,
the discerning heart, dread, fear, meekness,
cheerfulness, purity, attendance on the Wise,
discussion with associates, argument with
disciples, sedateness; Scripture, Mishnah;
having little business, little intercourse [with
the world], little luxury, little sleep, little conversation,
little merriment, forbearance, a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
heart, faith in the Wise, the acceptance of
chastisements, [He is one that] acknowledges
God, that rejoices in his lot, that makes a fence
for his words, that claims not goodness for
himself, that is loved, that loves God, that
loves mankind, that loves deeds of charity,
that loves uprightness, that loves reproofs, that
shuns honour [<i>i.e.</i> when offered to himself],
that puffs not up his heart with his learning,
that is not insolent in his teaching, that bears
the yoke along with his companion, that judges
him favourably, that establishes him upon truth,
that establishes him on peace, that settles his
heart in his study, that asks and answers, that
hears and adds thereto, that learns in order to
teach, and that learns in order to do, that
makes his teacher wise, that makes sure what
he hears, that repeats a word in the name of
him who said it." The remainder of the passage
has no bearing on the general subject, being
only a note upon the last clause. The author
is unknown. The list, which includes fifty-one
qualifications instead of the forty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
announced at the beginning, varies slightly
in different editions; but it may be taken as
representing substantially the ideal character
developed by and under the religion of Torah.
It may usefully be compared with the enumeration
of Christian virtues in Rom. xii.; and, if
that comparison is made, there will be noticed
that difference of tone and spirit to which I
have already alluded. But it will also appear,
from such comparison, that there is no contrast
as between black and white, hypocrite and
holy. The Pharisaic ideal may seem to be
drawn in terms of more level prose than the
Christian ideal as set forth by Paul, and,
moreover, to be one more capable of being
attained, in actual life. There is an element of
sober matter-of-fact in Judaism, and especially
in Pharisaic Judaism, which may not be sublime,
but has great value, nevertheless, in the
practical conduct of life, even the religious
life. Some of the items included in the
Pharisaic list may seem to be of but little
importance, such as those having immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
reference to the study of Torah&mdash;argument
with disciples, attendance on the wise, and
the repeating a saying in the name of him
who said it. These, and similar items, have to
be judged, of course, by the standard of the
supreme worth of the Torah. What that
meant to the Pharisee, how much more than
the mere study of a book, I do not now need
to repeat, after all that has been said in previous
chapters. But many of the items indicate the
great and substantial virtues and graces which
belong to the higher human nature alike of
the Pharisee and of the Christian. They
include love to God, love towards all mankind
(let it be noted especially, that love is not
restricted to Israel alone), sympathy, kindness,
forbearance, purity, meekness, cheerfulness,
contentment, patience under trial, and that
which a great Rabbi once said excelled all
other qualifications for the perfect life&mdash;a good
heart. A man who should strive after such
an ideal of character and conduct would follow
no unworthy quest; and, however different be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the form in which he expresses his religious
ideas from the form familiar to Christians,
there is no fundamental difference between
them in the desire to seek God and serve Him
with the noblest powers that He has given to
the human soul. It is not <i>quâ</i> man, but <i>quâ</i>
Pharisee that the adherent of the religion of
Torah is sundered from the Christian. There
was in him the same human nature, capable
of high development in its relation both to
God and to man. And the conception of
Torah was for the Pharisee the agent in that
development; while for the Christian the controlling
factor is personal relation to Christ.
I am not concerned to judge between these
two. I am concerned only to maintain that
the development of human nature through the
agency of Torah did in fact take place, and
did produce very great and noble results.</p>

<p>Pharisaism in history has had a hard fate.
For there has seldom been for Christians the
opportunity to know what Pharisaism really
meant, and perhaps still more seldom the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to use that opportunity. It has served as a
foil to Christianity, the way for such use being
prepared by the New Testament. Its supposed
blemishes have been held up to view, in order
that the excellences of the Christian religion
might shine the more brightly by comparison.
If learned men like Lightfoot, Wagenseil, and
especially Eisenmenger, explored the Rabbinical
literature well-nigh from end to end, it was
mainly for the purpose of reviling what they
found there. And, in our own day, though
there is no longer to be found amongst
Talmudic scholars the scurrilous rancour of an
Eisenmenger, there is still the inveterate habit
of regarding Rabbinical Judaism as a means of
exalting Christianity; there is nearly always
the criticism of Judaism from the Christian
point of view, and judgment given upon
premises which it never recognised. There is
scarcely any attempt to learn what it really
meant to those who held it as their religion,
who lived by it, and who died by it, and have
done for two thousand years.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Is, then, the Christian religion so weak that
it must be advocated by blackening the character
of its oldest rival? And if it should
appear, as I trust in some degree it has appeared,
that the religion of Torah as held by
the Pharisees was a real expression of spiritual
experience, the inspiration of holy living and
holy dying, is the spiritual power of Christianity
in any degree made less? Why should
the one begrudge to the other whatever is good
in it? Especially when the one has grown
great and has become the religion of many
nations, while the other has remained as the
inheritance of a lonely people? Why should
not the Christian be glad to own that the
Jew, even the Pharisee, knew more of the deep
things of God than he had supposed, and after
a way which was not the Christian way, yet
loved the Lord his God with heart and soul
and strength and mind,&mdash;yes, and his neighbour
as himself? The time is surely come when
Pharisaism should be recognised as a religion
entitled to be judged on its own merits and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
its own standards; a religion widely different
indeed from Christianity in its methods and its
forms of expression, but yet a living faith,
capable of ministering to the real wants of
human souls; a religion <i>sui generis</i>, but none
the less to be acknowledged as one among the
many expressions of divine revelation on the
one hand and of human seeking after God
on the other? It is in the hope of helping
towards such a sympathetic and unprejudiced
recognition of the intrinsic worth of Pharisaism
that I have written this book. What I have
written is scanty indeed, in view of the greatness
of the subject; but it may yet have been
enough to give some idea of what Pharisaism
meant to the Pharisee, and to show that the
Saints and Sages of Israel, those more particularly
who are included amongst the Scribes
and Pharisees, were not what they have
commonly been called and usually thought to
have been. Saints and Sages they were, who
served God faithfully, and found in the Torah
His full and perfect word. And to me, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
not walking in their way, nor sharing in all
their beliefs, yet drawn to them across the
ages, they have been the companions and
friends of many a year.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A close parallel to the term &#7716;asid, as denoting a type

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> To this may be added the fact that certain phrases,
apparently harmless, were forbidden to be used in the
Synagogue, because they were in some way heretical
(M. Meg. iv. 9). Christianity is not directly mentioned,
but there is good reason to suppose that Christianity is
intended.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I only quote these questions as being what must have
been asked at a very early stage of the public career of
Jesus: I offer no opinion as to the chronology of the
incidents in the Gospels in connection with which those
questions are introduced.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The action of Jesus in casting out devils was not in
itself a ground of controversy with the Pharisees, since
they did the same; and moreover neither side questioned
the genuineness of the exorcisms of the other. But it
appears from Mark iii. 22-30 that the Pharisees alleged
that Jesus performed his cures by the help of Beelzebub
the prince of the devils; and Jesus denounced them as
guilty of the sin against the Holy Spirit, for their malicious
slander in ascribing to diabolic agency what was due to
power from God. Then follows the famous declaration:
"Whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath
never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin" (Mark
iii. 29). This is the foundation for the doctrine of the
unpardonable sin, in Christian theology. It rests entirely
on a misunderstanding of the phrase, "hath never forgiveness,"
a misunderstanding already apparent in Matt. xii.
32, where it is said that such a one "shall not be forgiven
either in this world or in that which is to come." The
phrase in Mark, "hath never forgiveness," is the key to
the real meaning of the saying of Jesus. The Christian
reader, finding the phrase only in this one passage, naturally
supposes that it is very exceptional and carries some
tremendous meaning. But, in fact, it is a Jewish idiom
applicable in ordinary circumstances. In the Talmud,
j. B. Kama 6<sup>c</sup>, is a passage dealing with injuries and
affronts from one man to another. A Rabbi suggests a
method of reconciliation; upon which another Rabbi comments:
"This will do where it is not a case of slander; but
if he has put forth a bad name against his fellow-man, <i>he
hath not forgiveness for ever</i>." There is here no question of
a sin which God will not pardon, but of an affront which
man will not, or does not, pardon. It is only a way of
saying that slander is one of the hardest of all offences to
forgive. The Rabbi who said this never dreamed of an
unpardonable sin as Christians have imagined it. The
unvarying doctrine in Pharisaic theology on the subject
of forgiveness is that God always forgives those who
repent when they repent (see on forgiveness in Chapter IV.).
The term rendered "for ever" is used in the Talmud in
connections which preclude all idea of theological meaning.
Thus, j. M. Kat. 83<sup>d</sup>, of the rent garments of the mourner,
"They do not sew the pieces together <i>for ever</i>." The
declaration of Jesus accordingly is not the intimation that
there is a sin which God will never forgive, but the
denunciation of malicious slander by a justly indignant
man. The phrase, "is guilty of an eternal sin," is only
an expansion of "hath never forgiveness." It is worth
noting in this connection that the references to Jesus in
the Talmud do not include a charge that he was possessed
by a devil or made use of the help of the prince of the
devils. See my <i>Christianity in Talmud and Midrash</i>, where
all the Rabbinical passages relating to Jesus are collected
and commented on.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> "Corban" does not mean "Given to God," at least it
does not mean that the thing in respect of which the vow
was made was dedicated to sacred use. "Corban" is merely
a formula prefacing a vow. A man would say, "Corban!
if you shall enter my house!" meaning, "I vow that you
shall not enter it."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> See the often-quoted passage describing the seven
classes of Pharisees, b. Sotah 22<sup>b</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> I have been asked how I can reconcile this alleged
inability on the part of Jesus to understand the Pharisees
with the power he showed elsewhere of reading the
character and comprehending the thoughts of those with
whom he came into contact. My answer is that I do not
admit John ii. 25 as true of the historical Jesus; and that,
while I do not deny that he had deep insight into human
character and thought, such insight depends on sympathy.
That there was finally a complete absence of sympathy
between Jesus and the Pharisees is plainly to be seen, and
admits of no dispute. And, that being so, I submit even
he did not escape the effects of that limitation, in making
him unable to comprehend the position of the Pharisees.
The inability was on both sides, and for the same reason.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> I use in quotations from Paul the word Law instead of
Torah, because Paul spoke of N&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#962; [Greek: Nómos]. The fact that he did
so is characteristic of his whole conception of Judaism. If
the Greek language did not provide an equivalent of the
word Torah (any more than the English language does),
the fact still remains that an equivalent is needed, or the
argument becomes for want of it invalid.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The theory, of course, is conditioned by the fact of
Christ's coming when he did. It is an attempt to interpret
a historical fact in terms of world-history and eternal
wisdom.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> I have been asked if it were not possible that there
might be some section or school of the Pharisees to whom
Paul's strictures might apply? Even if there were any
evidence of such a school, that would not alter the fact
that Paul himself draws no such distinction, but condemns
the whole theoretical position of which the Halachah is
the expression. A Pharisee who should repudiate the
Halachah would be a contradiction in terms. My object
is to set forth, as truly as I can, what Pharisaism was, on
its own showing; and I am under no obligation to find a
means whereby the strictures of Paul might be made to
appear more relevant and valid than I have admitted them
to be.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The words ascribed to Jesus, John vii. 19, "Did not
Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the
law?" are clearly dependent on the Pauline conception of
the Torah. They are quite out of keeping with the
attitude of Jesus as set forth in the Synoptic Gospels.
And even Paul himself never went so far as to say, "None
of you doeth the law." He only said in effect, "None of
you keepeth the whole law." That the Gospel of John
represents a stage in the development of anti-Jewish
feeling later than that of Paul is further shown by the
statement in John xii. 42, "Nevertheless, even of the
rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees
they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the
synagogue." The policy of detecting secret adherents of
Jesus and casting them forth from the synagogue was not
adopted till <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 80, or thereabouts. See my <i>Christianity
in Talmud and Midrash</i>, p. 125 fol. If, as recorded in
John iii., Nicodemus really came to Jesus, he need not
have come secretly. And, if the name Nicodemus be
merely adapted from that of Nakdimon, a well-known and
prominent citizen of Jerusalem at the time of the siege, of
whom the Evangelist might have heard, then he did not
come to Jesus at all.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> When I say the "doctrine of repentance and restoration,"
I do not mean to imply that Rabbinical theology
was an organised and consistent system of doctrines.
Such it never was; and it is the fundamental fallacy of
Weber's book that he has so represented it. I shall go
into this subject, of the sense in which it is legitimate
to speak of the theology of the Rabbis, in the next
chapter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The process of building up the system is seen in the
Talmud. The Code, or the chief Code, is the Shul&#7717;an
Aruch, compiled in the sixteenth century by Joseph Caro.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This is Bacher's explanation, as given in an article in
the <i>J. Q. R.</i>, 1892, p. 406 fol. His argument seems to
me unanswerable.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> A Midrash says: "One text issues in many meanings....
The school of R. Ishmael teach (in reference to
Jer. xxiii. 29), 'Like a hammer that breaketh the rock';
as this is divided into many sparks, so even one text issues
in many meanings. For the way of the Holy One, blessed
be He, is not like the way of flesh and blood. For flesh
and blood cannot say two things at once. But He who
spake and the world was, uttered ten words in one act of
speaking, as it is said (Ps. lxii. 11), 'God hath spoken
once.' 'And God spake all these words, saying, etc.'"
(Exod. xx. 1). Yalkut Shim'oni on Ps. lxii. 11, § 783.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> As, <i>e.g.</i> when they give the name of Lot's wife, which
was Idith (Tan&#7717;. i. 45<sup>b</sup>), or are able to say that the fare
which Jonah paid to go in the ship was 4000 gold pieces
(b. Nedar. 38ª), or that Noah took with him into the ark
suitable food for the different creatures:&mdash;hay for the
camel, barley for the ass, grape-vines for the elephant, and
<i>glass</i> for the ostrich (Tan&#7717;. 15ª).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> See my <i>Christianity in Talmud and Midrash</i>, pp. 286-8.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> It is worth noting in passing that the name by
which the Pharisees called themselves and each other
was "&#7717;&#257;b&#275;r," "companion"; and their societies were
"&#7717;aburoth," "companies." In Ps. cxix. 63, the Psalmist
says, "I am <i>companion</i>, '&#7717;aber,' to all them that fear thee."
Whether the Psalmist used the term because he was a
Pharisee, or whether the Pharisees borrowed it from the
Psalm, I do not know; but there is evidently a connection
between them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> <i>Cf.</i> what was said, in Chapter III., of the position
taken up by the Pharisees in regard to the question of
healing on the Sabbath. See above, p. 149.</p>
